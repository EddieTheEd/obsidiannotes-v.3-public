I'm [Ed](about.md), and this website is essentially **Obsidian Publish on steroids**, i.e. *this is where I publish my obsidian notes*. \n\nI am a member of [the town](04-03-2023%20The%20town%20analogy.md), and I am a member of the [study group](Study%20Group%20Subjects.md).\n\nThe website runs using **Netlify** and **Quartz**, with special thanks to Jacky Zhao [(here is the github page)](https://github.com/jackyzha0), who essentially wrote all the code, did all the hard work, while I've just stolen it. :)\n\nAnd this is my [website philosophy](20-12-2022%20Website%20Philosophy).

The board is a continuation of the faithful [development status](Development%20Status.md), which I have decided to retire. We are no longer in the main development status!! :)\n\n## Why I should be your tutor\n[Here are some satisfied customers!](17-03-2023%20Tuition%20Reviews.md)\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n- For yr 11 chem, I recommend looking through the [Topic Notes](AECHE%20Topic%20Notes.md) above all, as most of the [Class Notes](AECHE%20Class%20Notes.md) are unformatted, and the [Published Notes](AECHE%20Published%20Notes.md) is looking quite barren. Please note however, I am yet to fully transition to a topic-style system when writing notes, so most of the topic notes have nothing in them. Do check out [Electron Configuration](Electron%20Configuration.md), I think its the only one with stuff.\n- For yr 12 chem, I haven't written \"topic notes\" or \"published notes\" per se, however I have made annotations to the R-ATCHE-x notes so that you know which general topic they belong to. (This is only for like the ones after the first few)\n- For the rest of the subjects, ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_\\/¯ there is no consistent structure general, so do whatever. No advice. \n- ~~The monkey face logo was chosen by Atharva Sathe. :)~~ the monkey has been assassinated\n\n\u003e [!important] Page Shoutout\n\u003e\n\u003e [R-AECHE-32](R-AECHE-32.md)\n\u003e \n\u003e Here you will learn the most crucial concept in chemistry.\n\n\u003e [!Warning] Chyme\n\u003e \n\u003e This cannot be done by simply adding water to the sulfur trioxide; the reaction is so uncontrollable that it creates a fog of sulfuric acid.\n\u003e  \n\u003e $H_{2}SO_{4(l)}+SO_{3(g)}\\rightarrow H_{2}S_{2}O_{7(l)}$\n\n\"thanks for this infomation that i will definitely not mis-use\"\n\n*124*\n\n## A very cool imag\n[[Pranav and Co]]\n\n\n\u003e [!danger] A quote of all time\n\u003e\n\u003e \"I love children\"\n\u003e\n\u003e Jlee\n\n\u003e [!danger] A quote of all time\n\u003e\n\u003e \"I love nuts\"\n\u003e\n\u003e Jlee\n\n\n## Very awesome quotes (definitely not completely and utterly stolen from kento)\n[an random collation of quotes](07-04-2023%20An%20random%20collation%20of%20quotes.md)\n\n## Word of the day\n- Verisimilitude\n- [Objective correlative](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/objective-correlative)\n\n## Version\n4!",

    "title": "02-02-2023 Some thoughts on working better",
    "content": "\n*I should add this really only applies to me. Maybe you're like me though.*\n\n## Schedules suck\nI dont like meticulous planning. I thought I did, but I dont. I think the whole figuring out the exact hours you're gonna put into a single subject place restrictions on that subject and cause internal pressures, quite similarly to when you apply force to glass. The glass develops these internal pressures which causes the glass to become much weaker than it was original, and can lead to it breaking unexpectedly. Anyways, schedules suck.\n\n## Agenda based system *may* work\nHere's the thought process. No spreadsheet of hours. Just a list of things to do and the self control to attempt to do those things. Currently I plan to use some sort of a priority system, that will indicate due dates. For example, p1 would be due the day after, p2 within the week, p3 2 weeks and so on.\n\n## Does this work?\nI'll try it tomorrow. Right now I'm quite tired and don't have the energy to set these things up.\n\n## Well, damn.\nIt's 2 days later. I haven't started. Band is quite mentally draining. I'll figure it out tomorrow and write up all the stuff. But now I've been looking into todoist integrations, which could potentially be cool, or could potentially be a massive time-sink for little reward. I think the idea is sound, it's just I need to find the self motivation to do things. :(\n\n## 06-02-2023\nI've decided to turn this into a log of sorts regarding productivity. Hey this could literally be a blog! Haha just kidding blogs are for losers\n\nAnyways I found this app on Android called Forest. Its kinda pommodorro but not pommodorro and its just a timer that \"grows trees\" and kills trees if you get distracted. Kinda cool. Got me thinking about being more focused when studying.\n\nAnyways anyways, I think this whole to-do list is a good idea. Also Christian gave me some sticky notes so I'll try to use that. By \"use\" I mean I leave them on my computer and write small tid-bits that can be useful.\n\nAnyways anyways anyways, I've been quite productive recently, doing chem and stuff. Hopefully this sticks and I manage to productify myself into making a decent system.\n\n## 10-02-2023\nSo I've been very busy in the past few days, i.e. so busy I haven't been able to do anything but work. I guess this is a good system? But I've found this methodology of mindlessly doing stuff for the sake of doing inefficient and often missing the point. Not poggers. But now its the weekend, maybe some miracle idea will hit me.\n\nI am considering using [Amie](https://www.producthunt.com/products/amie-2) because it looks cool and todoist is expensive. But essentially I'm looking for something that will send notifications to my Samsung watch because I keep forgetting my classes :(\n\n## 24-02-2023\nSince I want to integrate quartz into this, I may have to completely scratch the whole folder thing in place of organisational nodes. I wanted the folders cause I wanted to use the funny plugin I found (rapid notes) but I guess it's not really worth saving a few seconds in place of having the majority of my website be depreciated. Shame.\n\nAlso, HOW DO YOU SIGN UP FOR AMIE PLEASE HELP\n\nI am considering making some sort of indux/nexus file which is like a directory to all the possible topics. It should be sorted quite like the notes.md page, and link to all possible topics, even the weird \"rabbit holes\".\n\n### The Goal\nHere is my goal for the grand reformation, i.e. the upgrade from v.2 to v.3 I will make it so that every single page in my vault is accessible via graph nodes, and every single page is linked and formatted. I have a weekend to do so before I have to get into studying for assessments. I don't think I can do it but I'll definitely do my best.\n\n\n## 24-03-2023\nWoah its been exactly a month!!\n\nLet me recap what's happened so far:\n- Nodes were linked. All the pages that I want you to see can be accessed via the index.\n- Themes!!! Actually did some coding (for once) and add a bunch of sweet themes.\n- Light mode crusade. I crusaded against the light mode. I will make it as hard as possible to use light mode.\n\nSo how have I been productivity wise?\n\nNot that great.\n\nI've been bogged down by assessments, but now I have a free week. So now would be a great time to contemplate some other methods of working better. Here's one I came up with in the shower:\n- No calendar/timetable(ish). No need to allocate specific times of the day to work\n- **Instead**, allocate times of the day for \"study\", just in general. No specifics\n- Maintain a \"Set list\". You can see that I've tried to do that in the writing file, but its hidden (l bozo). When you are doing \"Study\", you will work on the things on the set list, e.g. Set 16 Lucarelli. You can arrange these things based on the priority, i.e. if you have a Chinese test upcoming you might want to do the Chinese-related \"sets\" first.\n\nBenefits: Not specific\nDrawbacks: How to motivate oneself to do work? Kinda applies to everything. How do solve this? No Clue.\n",

    "title": "03-03-2023 A letter to myself",
    "content": "\n*100% stolen from jzhao*\n*Editor's Note: I may or may not be doing a yearly letter to myself, like Jzhao. I dunno. Probably not.*\n*Second Editor's Note: Quite clearly i lost the plot on this one. It's not really a letter to myself, its an open letter regarding how i see life in school. Probably will try again next time?*\n\n## The Setting\n\nPerhaps Marx was right. Not about communism, but the existence of class. Maybe that's an established fact, I dunno, but there seems to be class, and thus class warfare everywhere.\n\nIt seems class has infiltrated all parts of society. Even education.\n\nInside and outside observers will notice there is an uneven playing field for academic success. \n\nSadly, money is a key factor in all of this. The \"elite nomads\", as a certain \"M.Spicata\" would call them, are successful over the others for many reasons. They pay for tutors. They have their siblings help them. They hoard their resources for their own benefit.\n\nBut most of all, they are confident. I am not here to attack the \"elite nomads\", because knowing some of them I've come to realise they kinda deserve to be \"elite\". They study more, they think more deeply, they live more holistically, etc. \n\nYet, inequality still prevails. And as long as this inequality still exists, the potential of those who feel disadvantaged is lost forever.\n\nThese people are not stupid. They are not lazy. They are just neglected by a system that favours those who show signs of \"intelligence\"(I don't like that word) **early on**. These children appear smart to their parents, hence they invest in early education, hence they gain the upper edge and boom, we have an unequal distribution of students. \n\nI mentioned class in the beginning because that's what it feels like. It feels like we live in a community of aristocrats vs absolute buffoons. This is not poggers.\n\n## A mission\nSo, what to do? How do we make the playing ground equal?\n\nFunnily enough, this ties into the internet movements of our generation. How do we make data free and open source (FOSS)? \n\nHere's a breakdown of my plan so far.\n\n### What makes a student good?\n- Understanding the concepts\n\t- I offer my class notes online, so people can use them to understand the ideas taught through my own lens (quality not guaranteed).\n- Practice, practice practice\n\t- This is in the works. I am attempting to compile a comprehensive storage of past papers(for the subjects I do and a few others). **Let it be known, that to the best of my knowledge these past papers were legally sourced. If they are not, then I will gladly abide by any request from an official to have specific files removed.** \n\t\t- Just had to get that out of the way, since this is probably the first time I've publicly mentioned this outside of a few close friends.\n\n### Tackling the problem\nThe prerogative of these goals are not to make the \"elite\" \"eliter\" and \"stupid\" \"stupider\". I want these supporting materials of education to be widely available for everyone. \n\nThis way, everyone can be great. Everyone can learn well, and have the ability to practice to become even better. The goal is to lift the chains of society off the young student, and to give them the choice. To let them decide whether a life of academic success is what they want, in comparison to them wanting such a life but being able to achieve so.\n\n## An issue\nI like to learn. I like doing well in school. I like having good grades. But at some point, I need to ask myself,\n\n\u003e [!Quote] \n\u003e Is this really what I want?\n\nBecause doing all of this is mentally draining. In the tragically zero-sum game of student life I, and others, play, our crusade for freer education comes at the price of our own. \n\nAnd the thought of that scares me. I don't want to throw away my ideals for my own, greedy, selfish goals.\n\nBut.\n\nBut.\n\n### Morality?\nUtilitarianism is widely believed to be the best ethical theory when considering yourself as an individual among society. Yet, we as individuals *should* reserve the right to fight for ourselves. \n\nWhile a brave, dedicated soldier may die for his country, one must not overlook the fact that the soldier could've lived a much longer life, in happiness and in health.\n\nHence, an issue. \n\n\u003e [!Quote] \n\u003e At what point am I dedicating too much to this?\n\n\n## Departure\nI am considering giving it all up.\n\nNot obsidian. But the website thing.\n\nTo live in peace and isolation, working only for myself\n\nTo join the \"elite nomads\" in the goal to be the best.\n\nBecause to be the best, there must exist those who are worse.\n\nThose who simply **must** be neglected, so the \"elite\" may thrive.\n\nThinking.\n\nThinking.\n\n*S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse*\n*A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,*\n*Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.*\n*Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo*\n*Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,*\n*Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.*\n\nWith love(and a bit of sadness in my heart),\n\nEd",

    "title": "04-03-2023 The town analogy",
    "content": "\n*in reference to [christian's article](https://spicata.github.io/theTown.html)*\n\n*what follows is a visualised welcome, where interjections will be notated via brackets.*\n\nWelcome! As a founding member of the town, it is my honour to welcome you to our fine establishment.\n\nIt's tough living in the desert(school). Gusts of wind(assessments) and even mighty sandstorms(exams) have ravaged the land beyond recognition. \n\nYet, we still stand. Slightly bruised, but flourishing none-the-less.\n\nYou may be curious how this little settlement in the middle of nowhere came to fruition. Well, it started with two.\n\nMe, and [Christian](https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes/) saw what others didn't. While they saw this place as a barren wasteland(school) where people go to die, we saw this as a utopia in the waiting. A land of safety, freedom, and refuge from the terrible sandstorms that run amok. \n\nSo we set up here. You can see [his house](https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes/) and [his store](https://spicata.github.io/) right around the corner.\n\nI'll be truthful with you. There were actually 4 founders. It's just that two of them(mace, osacr) haven't been seen in a while. They may be dead(given up), they may have moved out of town(focus on academics). Who knows? Their houses are locked, so we can't check on them. And I dare not commit breaking and entering.\n\nTheir houses are still visible from the town square. You can see [mace's](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/) on the hill over there, right next to [osacr's](https://notes.notmario.net/).\n\nIn the past few days or so, we've been incredibly lucky. My (jzhao's(this is not an interjection this is the truth i literally stole jzhao's template)) house designs seem to have piqued the interests of some nearby nomads(non-website owners, who live in the desert). In fact, my good friend from work [Thomas](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/) has emigrated to our town for a life away from the desert. His house is right next to mine! Luckily for us, Thomas is a great architect(coder), and his house is already looking good.\n\nLuckily for the town, my \"colleague\" has also set up shop here. His calls himself the [\"Reaper\"](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/), and he's a cool guy. He likes tanks. Who doesn't?\n\nI got an odd request from an old friend of mine. He also decided to take refuge in the town, but currently he's living in a shell of a house. His name is [jlee](https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/). ~~Hopefully he starts putting some walls up(website content) in time for the upcoming sandstorm.~~\n\nUpdate: His house is now looking a little more secure. Good on him.\n\nA visitor came to the town. They decided to set up here. You can see her house right [over here](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/). They also play a lot of instruments. Based\nstorage\nI may have asked her to come and live in this town. Maybe.  I may have \"nagged\" her. Just a little. Very very slightly.\n\nI'm an entrepreneurial individual. I sell tea and spaghetti.\n\n**You may have heard that my house is quite volatile. That it has burnt down twice. This is fake news. Absolute rubbish.**\n\nAnyways, another friend of mine set up shop in this town of ours. But, he kinda owes a lot of debt to this random company in America. I think his house is co-owned by said company. He lives far off from the centre of the town. He's often forgotten. His name is [dasindu](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/).\n\nReportedly, Dasindu has plans to relocate to an even better house on a more scenic location. He's been talking about it quite frequently in our town gatherings, and has been talking to M.Spicata about his plans. M.Spicata tells me that he's been doing most of the work. Certified Dasindu NPC moment.\n\nSome weird chicken farmer came to settle here. He's Japanese so naturally I'm a little suspcious (have not forgotten the 2nd Sino-Japanese war), but he seems like a cool guy. He loves making me- I mean chemistry jokes. Yeah. Chemistry jokes. He set up [over here](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/), and when he arrived he went around giving bread and salt to everyone (haha subtle german reference cause chicken farmer(no one will get the reference (and the reference inside the reference dammit))).\n\nSome weird guys showed up. They kept on talking about \"moving points\"(like what?), and they have a lot to talk about. Hey, at least they asked me to help them set up in the town. You can find [my love](https://rubver16.github.io/joles-notes/) and [the other weird guy](https://super-cookies.github.io/duk/) ~~in the distant horizon.~~ \n\nUpdate: The weird guy bribed me, so now he is not in the distant horizon anymore, he is in fact relocated to the centre of the town!\n\nThat's all of the houses in town as of now. Let's talk about something else.\n\nJust some context about how the town is structured. The 4 founders live in what's called the old side of the town. Dasindu also lives here, but he's a bit far back. The new settlers(Thomas, Jlee, Reaper, etc.) reside in what's called the new side of the town.\n\nAll citizens of the town offer their own unique wares for your perusal. You may stay as long as you like, and just so you know it's all free. I think.\n\nThere's plenty of space in the new side of town. Please, if you're sick of struggling in the desert, come to us. We welcome you with open arms. We'll even help you in building your house. I'm known to help out occasionally, same as Christian.\n\nMaybe someday we'll be able to live like the nomads. To be one with the harsh desert environment.\n\nLike Dune.\n\nBy Frank Herbert\n\nAnyone else think the Dune franchise peaked after the first 2 books? Like what the heck? Chapterhouse? Wacky Noah's arc in space?\n\n*With love(but not for dasindu),*\n\n*Ed, a  founder of The Town*\n",

And people who pay more attention in class probably get better results (many exceptions of course).\n\nHowever, I'm yet to cover the more important aspect of study, **self revision**. That is the part of the graph where the gradient starts to approach 0. It becomes much more harder to go from a 95% to a 100%, for example, than from a 60% to a 70%.\n\nHence, the crux of my thesis is that most of the effort we need to put into our studies is only to get our grade from a good one to an exceptional one.\n\n## The point\nSo, what is the takeaway from this? **Learn your topics early!** Even if you don't fully understand them, it saves you time when you are actually learning them. You can spend that time revising and actually practising the topics for greater proficiency. i.e. You should aim to skip the high-gradient area of the graph by learning the topics earlier. \n",

    "content": "\nI love the town. I love the concept. I love the people who make it possible.\n\nHowever, there's something wrong with it.\n\nAnd no, before you ask, this is not [me leaving again](09-04-2023%20A%20change%20in%20course.md). I'm still here! I'm still part of the town, I think.\n\nBut there is a critical flaw. \n\nThe town is built on the premise that our code will, forever, be open sourced. It will be free. However, I don't see how this applies to the non-code work we have done. The things we write. The things we work on. The advice we provide, out of our own compassion.\n\nSadly, this exemption is apparently not the case.\n\nI am unsure whether this is a general consensus among town people, or just the abusive, hegemonic beliefs of an individual, but the subsequent environment that has been cultivated is not one of personal freedom, where we come together to make something beautiful. It is one of tyranny. Of single-minded thought. Of a lack of compassion.\n\nWe are required, by the \"rules\" of the town, which are not even set in writing, to make everything open source. To have all our work, all the labours of our love, open for everyone to see. Even if a mistake is to be made, something truly personal is uploaded, we are required to keep it up.\n\nEven if something that you worked hard for, that you literally put in hours writing, that you want to be used correctly, can be downloaded and used, at the dismay and disapproval of its original writer.\n\nThis is the crux of the issue I believe lies at the centre of the town. There is a culture of **assimilation**, not **collaboration**.\n\nAnd this culture persists, to the point where if I change the visibility of my repo, and simply make another which has *all the added code alongside the actual code used to run the website*, apparently that makes me not a part of the town anymore.\n\nSo I have a question for the town, or should I say the town's dictator. Where is the common sense? \n\n**In a town, where the ideals of FOSS, personal freedom, anti-corporate jingo, etc. are so freely and openly spread, how can one possibly consider themselves an emancipator, a democrat for free thought and collaboration when they themselves diminish the rights of their colleagues?**\n\nI have followed through, and separated my website into two repositories. And so, I have a final message. \n\nTo the person who prides himself with being \"free and open source\"(which is hypocritical since, your website is so badly made you can't access most of the things).\n\nTo the person who controls the town like a child playing in their doll house.\n\nTo the freedom fanatic, who goes on and on about how free his website is, while ensnaring others like a snake.\n\nTo the democrat, who asserts himself like a dictator.\n\nWhat are you gonna do about it?",

But I probably won't change my mind. I'm kinda sick of the whole mentality of being dominated by Christian and his erratic ideas. \n\nEver since Christian started being a *little* aggressive with his control over the Town, it's become toxic beyond belief. I literally can't even share and contribute notes without both being criticised and then threatened to be removed from the town. Now I'm not even sure I want a website anymore, if people are going to be this mean :(\n\nI believe in free education. I believe in free speech. I believe in critical discourse. But this is too far. I have a right to my own work, and I have a right to that work being respected. \n\nI don't hold any resentment towards the majority of the town people. They are just there for the ride. But I think I'm going to move away from the town. Settle down somewhere better and make my own place on the internet. \n\nIn truth, I want to be able to control who sees my website to a greater extent. I don't think Github is able to offer this. Furthermore I want to decrease visibility of the code (and the md files) so that people like Christian can't just look at old versions and take things I've asked not to use.\n\nFor the rest of the town, I'm still here if you need any coding help. I am glad to help people set up their own websites, regardless of whether they align with the town or not.\n\nThe town had so much potential. It probably still does. Maybe it can thrive without me. But I can't stand to be there anymore, given how unequal it is, how I and my intellectual work is being mistreated for an agenda I don't fully agree with. \n\nI still have dreams of a decentralised mechanism, of a town that has reached its true potential. Those dreams will never die, and I will work to see that dream reached. \n\nI wanted to integrate the town with CARD and the Past Papers drive, to make something truly great, and to prove that you don't need to pay to have good resources. I guess that dream is still attainable, just without the town. \n\nI'm sure this seems like a very silly, childish reaction. But no, I've been thinking about this for a long time. Ever since it first happened, the thought that Christian, or other people, could just take my work for granted and worst of all, against my own will, disgusted me in a way that was both infuriating and melancholic (thanks christian).\n\nI truly wish all the members of the town the best. It would be truly rewarding to see in a few months (or weeks) that the town is prospering, and that for a brief moment I was part of it.\n\nI desperately wish the town could've been as I hoped; safe, collaborative, encouraging, etc. Maybe that was too much to ask. But that's all right. \n\nHoping for a better future,\n\n*a very sadge ed*\n\n*to be free*",

    "title": "10-03-2023 Tuition Philosophy",
    "content": "\n## Preface\n\nWhy do people tutor?\n1. Money\n2. Enjoyment\n\nThis is axiomatic. I ain't gonna argue about this. Cause cmon, most tutors (the good ones) are uni students who want some amount of disposable income.\n\n## Effort\n\n\"What can a tutor add?\"\n\nWell, this question is quite intricate. One might consider a preliminary question, such as, \"How many students does the tutor have?\"\n\nWhy is this important? Because quantity of students has a significant impact on the quality of tuition. \n\nSay for example, you have a tutor like me, who only teaches 1 student.\n\nThey can focus all your efforts on that one student, and put in their time and love into getting them the results they want.\n\nNow contrast that thought with a tutor, who takes 10 students weekly.\n\nTheir timetable is spread out. Cause they're probably busy with uni things. They have to deal with 10 students, hence the quality of their teaching decreases since they are simply not able to maintain a standard of teaching similar to the one-student tutor.\n\nWith that in mind, think \"What can a tutor add\"?\n\nTutors with more students may have the same total effort compared to tutors with just a few, yet because of the quantity of students, this effort is distributed, i.e. fractured, hence the actual effort students receive in their tuition is reduced.\n\n## Balance\n\nTutors can definitely increase grades, for sure. But, there's something more to it. \n\nHow I see it, there are two meters that a good teacher must balance:\n- Profit\n- Quality\n\nThese two come hand in hand, yet are inversely related.\n\nWith massive profits, a tutor must take many students, resulting in a reduced quality of tuition.\n\nYet, doing things like teaching one-on-one increases the value of the tuition(and the quality), hence tutors can change more, resulting in increased profit.\n\nWhile one might initially perceive these two things as mutually exclusive (in terms of maximising), there are little exceptions to such a rule.\n\n## Two Types\n\nFor the sake of this page, I will classify tutors into two types:\n- Survivalists\n- Successers\n\nYes I'm aware these words are nonsensical. Just go with the flow my g.\n\n### Tutoring for survival\n\nThe survivalists, as I have called them, teach students who really \"need\" tuition.\n\nThese are the people who are really struggling, and need tuition to bump their grades from say a 40% to a 65%.\n\nSure. Those people need tuition. They need it to get better grades. Yet, in reality there is a duality of the kind of student the survivalists teach.\n\nThere is the legitimately struggling student. This one works as hard as they possibly can, they struggle and struggle, yet they don't get the marks they want. Not because they couldn't, but for external factors out of their control. Maybe their teachers are bad. Maybe they don't have access to resources, like past papers. Maybe they've been sick and need catching up. Maybe all of those things. \n\nThat kind of student can't really help their situation, so I feel it is fine that they get tutored by the survivalists.\n\nThen, there are the lazy students. They could work to increase their grades, by themselves. But they are lazy. They play video games till 2am the night (or day, depends how you see it) before an assessment. And before you take a jab at me for being mean to other people, I consider myself to be partially if not wholly part of this group. I definitely could work better, do more study, etc.\n\nThese people get tutored out of necessity. Maybe their parents force tuition onto them. Regardless, it is quite difficult to tutor these kinds of people.\n\n#### To tutor someone who doesn't care\nSuppose for the sake of the argument that lazy students are lazy because they don't care about grades. They don't care about the subjects they learn. \n\nHence, from a tutor's perspective, it will be **much more** difficult to push this student, to actually overcome their apathy and get them to learn, and in doing so to increase their grades. At the same time, such a process is boring, laborious, and mentally draining. \n\nTutors don't really want to do this. They want to avoid this as best they can. Because it's so god damn tiring and difficult to do so, for the same pay as one of the other students.\n\nHence, in summary, tutors(survivalist tutors to be specific) **do not want to tutor lazy students, who do not care about the subject**.\n\n### Tutoring for success\n\nThe successers seek to tutor students who are relatively good at school. The ones who get 90%, maybe 80%. Their goal is to push their score to the upper limits, like \u003e 95%. \n\nThese students, who can already get like high 80%s, most certainly care about their subject (or their are tutored to death). They are passionate, and enjoy learning that subject, and the marks subsequently reflect as such. \n\nHence, it is a joy to tutor these kinds of students because they are able to learn. They want to do better. They are inquisitive, and ask questions that demonstrate some semblance of critical thinking about the subject, and most importantly what the tutor has taught them. \n\nTutors are quite happy to teach these kinds of students, as they don't have to force this information onto them. \n\nIn summary, successer tutors **enjoy teaching passionate students**\n\n\n## A choice, one that is one-sided\n\nThis leaves tutors with a choice. They can choose to be a survivalist, or successer. \n\nIf they choose survivalist, they find themselves sorting through students, searching for one who actually needs their help, since otherwise their time and care would be wasted on students who simply don't want to learn. This would be a struggle for them, and not bring them as much value, financially and emotionally.\n\nIf they choose successer, they get good, capable students who are a joy to teach. Furthermore, they can somewhat make up the difference from being a survivalist teacher with many students, by charging a quality fee. The financial and emotional value presented is simpler and generally greater than if they were purely survivalist.\n\nThe math is simple. \n\n\u003e [!Quote]\n\u003e **Tutors(at least the ones I've met) should tend towards being successers.** \n\n## Quick Summary\nIn my opinion(this is all my opinion please take with a grain of $NaCl$), the best tutor is one who takes a few capable students.\n\nYea dunno why i ranted on about tutors for 1k words. Kinda weirdchamp, but i'm in the mood to write something so why not.\n\n*With love(but not for dasindu),*\n\n*Ed*",

Unfortunately, this version will actually be mostly a downgrade of the previous one. Excluding bug fixes, I plan to pull back on most of the \"open-source\" features of the website.\n\nCurrently, I'm struggling to figure out whether I should change the license for the repo, but that would go against Jzhao's MIT license. In fact, now I'm contemplating whether I should even have a website. I feel like my values more align with Pranav at this moment.

A 'variable' that DOESN'T CHANGE\n\nconstants could be created before a program\n\ne.g. anyone paying over 100 gets 5% discount\n\nthis 5% is now a constant\n\nconstants and variables use different types of DATA TYPES\n- string\n\t- text\n- integer\n\t- a whole number\n- float/real (ALTERNATIVE NAME)\n\t- a decimal number\n- boolean\n\t- True/False, yes/no\n- character\n\t- single symbol\n\nCOMPLEX DATA TYPES:\n- arrays\n\t- a list of data of THE SAME TYPE\n\t-e.g. only 'a', 'b', 'c', or '453,'345345','34534', cant have '43', '19.12423'\n\nBINARY:\n\nsource code: code created in a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, i.e. something a human could understand\n\nonce the source code is done, it is converted to machine code.\n- we cannot understand this code, only machines can understand\n\nBUT there is a code IN BETWEEN the machine and source code\n\nthis code is for virtual machines, and is called BYTE CODE.\n\ne.g. convert 32 to binary\n32/2 = 16 -\u003e 0\n16/2 = 8 -\u003e 0\n8/2 = 4 -\u003e 0\n4/2 = 2 -\u003e 0\n2/2 = 1 -\u003e 0\n1/2 -\u003e1\n\ntherefore 32 in binary is 100000 (start from the end)\n\nFIRST QUESTION OF THE TEST:\n- control structures\n- 3 control structures: sequence, selection, repetition\n\nsequence:\n- most basic thing, every pseudocode has sequence indicated by begin and end\n\nselection:\n- 3 types: single, double, multiple\n\t- single: IF\n\t- double: IF, ELSE\n\t-multiple has 2 types:\n\t\t-nested if, i.e. IF, ELIF, ELIF, ELSE\n\t\t- CASE\n\n\nrepetition:\n- 3 types: while, for, repeat until\n\t- while: tests from the start, which is why its called FIRST TEST. this means the condition is tested at the end of the program\n\t\t- the program may not even run, if the condition is not even met\n\t- for loop has things:\n\t\t- FIX: amount of repetitions known by the program, e.g. for range(5)\n\t\t\t- e.g. if you get password wrong 3 times, you are locked out. in this situation, it would be better to use for loop.\n\t- repeat until: test from the end, which is why its called the LAST/END TEST.\n\t\t- the program runs AT LEAST ONE\n\nREMEMBER THE SYMBOLS!!!!!!!!!!\n\nalso, ERRORS!!!\nTypes of Errors:\n- Syntax\n- Runtime\n- Logic\n\nRuntime: the program works, but doesn't work as intended, so its essentially a logic error. but in this case, you dont have time to stop it, and you produce a crash. e.g. you get an infinite loop.\nLogic: you put in an incorrect logic?/function?\nSyntax: when you don't type it right, the program WILL NOT WORK.\n\t- depending on the type of program, the programming language will identify errors differently.\n\n2 types of ways: Compiler and interpreter\n\nBOTH CONVERT SOURCE CODE TO MACHINE CODE\n\n- interpreter converts line by line\n- compiler converts it all\n\ncompiler is much faster, as its not going line by line. HOWEVER, AS IT DOES IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME, IT CANT IDENTIFY WHERE OR WHAT THE ERROR IS.\n\nfor interpreters, as its going line by line, it will tell you where errors are, which line they are, and what type.\n\nTHEY CANNOT IDENTIFY LOGIC ERRORS, AND GENERALLY CANNOT FIND RUNTIME ERRORS (unless it just straight up crashes)\n\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY LOGIC ERRORS:\n- trace table\n\nthere are two types of trace tables:\n- condensed\n- extend\n\n\n![](000_Files/structure%20chart.png)\n\n",

The way they are connected to each other is considered **transmission media**.\n\nThere are 2 types of transition media:\n- **Wired**: Ethernet cable, fibre-optic cable,\n- **Wireless**: Bluetooth, microwave/satellite\n\nImportant concept: **Protocols**\n\nProtocols have names and numbers, e.g. ip.\n\n- Ip stands for **internet protocol**, this is essential for where packaged information is send and received.\n- This is related for the addresses to which data is sent, e.g. IPV4, and IPV6\n\nIPV4 is made of 32 bits, \n\nbyte is 8 bits, each bit is a number. These numbers can be an address. this amount of possibilities allows for multiple options\n\nBut we are running out of addresses, so we make IPV6, with 128 bits, but this is too big, so we use hexadecimal.\n\nThis is all part of a protocol.\n\n# How to connect to the internet?\n\nA **modem** connects to the internet. \n\nModem stands for modulator-demodulator,\nit modulates from analogue to digital, and then demodulates from digital to analogue.\n\nIn our home, we only have one device, called a **router**. The role of the router is sending packages of data to all the devices in a network.\n\nWhat is a firewall? It is a **software**. It **filters packages** and checks if they are malicious packages or not. Will prevent viruses, malware, etc. that could possibly attack the local network\n\nThese 3 devices, a *modem*, *firewall*, and *router*, make up the things that link devices to the internet.\n\nBut there are more complex components of a local network. \n\nWe will use **cisco** to map out these networks.\n\nOur \"stupid computers\" connect to the internet via the **Wireless Access Point**.\n\n\n\nBut, if we were to send files to the shared storage for example, we *don't use internet*. \n\n*Servers* are computer with a lot of memory and space, and serve as storages for data. The **shared drive** stores data on the server. \n- It can store all types of data, e.g. programs, music, pictures, etc.\n\n\n",

The application layer. The data to be sent is found in the application layer\n\t- Transport \n\t\t- How is the data transferred?\n\t- Internet\n\t\t- Address of device sending + address of device receiving\n\t\t- DIfference between IPv4 and IPv6:\n\t\t\t- v4: 32 bit address\n\t\t\t\t- Number of ip addresses running out\n\t\t\t\t- uses 1010\n\t\t\t\t- Older\n\t\t\t- v6: 128 bit address\n\t\t\t\t- Uses hexadecimal numbers?\n\t\t\t\t- uses 1010 + hex\n\t\t\t\t- Newer\n\t\t\t**Both used at the same time**\n\t- Link\n\t\t- Type of transmission media in which this data is sent.\n\t\t- Maximum distance of bluetooth: **5m**\n\t\t- Ethernet cable is the most popular link protocol. There are two types:\n\t\t\t- UTPC - Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable\n\t\t\t\t- Set of 4 pairs of twisted cables.\n\t\t\t\t- In the middle, there is usually a separation. This results in 2 more types of cables:\n\t\t\t\t\t- CAT5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Doesn't have the separator in the middle.\n\t\t\t\t\t- CAT6\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Has separator. This is used to defend against **interference**\n\t\t\t- STPC - Shielded Twisted Pair Cable\n\t\t\t- **Ethernet cables are generally 100m viable length!!!**\n\t\t- Another Link protocol is Fibre-optic cables, different types *for different needs*:\n\t\t\t- Single Mode\n\t\t\t\t- One packet of data at a time\n\t\t\t\t- **Sends 1 packet of data at a time.**\n\t\t\t\t- **Longer range and faster**\n\t\t\t- Multi Mode\n\t\t\t\t- Multiple packets of data at a time\n\t\t\t\t- Can send **more data in shorter period of time**\n\t\t\t\t- **Shorter range and slower**\n\t\t\t-  e.g. in building to building, distance not that fast, so can use multi mode, in school to use, distance long, so use single mode\n\t\t- Another one is **coaxial cables**\n\t\t\t- Thick diameter of copper cables with multiple layers of protection\n\t\t\t- This is very expensive, so only used for specific cases!\n\t- **The reverse way is how someone receives the data!!!**\n\t\t- This reverse way are called the **protocols**. \n\t\t- **Wireless Examples:**\n\t\t\t- Broadcast Satellite\n\t\t\t- Microwave\n\t\t\t\t- Main Disadvantage, there has to be a direct, clear line between the 2 devices. If there is an object obstructing the transmission, the data is damaged(?)\n\t\t\t- Cellular\n\t\t\t\t- Tower provides access to multiple mobile devices. This tower connected to another tower, which provides access to other mobile devices, etc.\n\t\t\t\t- This is called **cellular**, because one tower connected to multiple devices is **one cell**.\n\t\t\t- WiFi\n\t\t\t\t- Device that provides access in a small area of connectivity.\n- OSI Model\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221104092753.png)\n\n### Hardware\n- Typically, networking hardware includes:\n\t- Routers\n\t- Bridges\n\t- Switches\n\t- Hubs\n\t- Repeaters\n\t- Gateways\n\nDevices:\n- Computer\n- Printer\n- Wireless tablet\n- WAP\n- 3 things in a device (gateway):\n\t- Modem (see below)\n\t- Firewall \n\t\t- Software that filters packets of data that come into a **local network**\n\t- Router\n### Bridge\n- \"like a switch\" (this is me speaking now) \"for networks\"\n- ~~Receive messages distributed through a network and sends to other networks.~~\n- Connects **network segments** within a domain together.\n\n### Switches\n- Switches have 5-48 ports. 24 ports is common.\n- Switches connect many devices to each other in a network.\n- Routers send and receive data from another network to the switch, switch sends and receives this data to other devices. \n\n### Modem\n- Converts analogue data to digital data, and vice versa.\n- Comes from \"**Mo**dulate, **Dem**odulate\".\n\t- I.e. convert one type of data to another, vice versa\n\n### Router\n- Send packets of data to other networks\n\n### Packets of data:\n- Packets are sent in **bytes**!\n- Bytes are 8 bits!\n\t- Bits are binary numbers.\n- e.g. 1 packet could be 01010101\n- All this numbers are just electrical inputs sent through copper cables. It comes out as ones and zeroes, but we aren't actually transmitting ones and zeroes.\n- 1 - ON\n- 0 - OFF\n- During an electrical storm, and using a satellite, there *is a chance* that the data is received differently.\n- e.g. from 01010101 to 01010010\n- This is called a bitflip, and **computers have evolved to fight against bitflips**. For example, if a computer cannot recognise a packet, it will return the packet.\n- Even parity: N(ones) is the same\n\t- ~~Odd parity: N(ones) is not the same~~\n- Lets say packets were even parity, then knowing what the parity is, a computer can check the packet and see whether its still even parity.\n\t- This has flaws. Let's say that a packet has 3 ones. Bitflips can occur that maintain 3 ones. This means the packet is not returned, if using even parity.\n\n### Network Diagram\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221104101741.png)\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] Important!\n\u003e Use Cisco System for default diagrams.\n\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221106191623.png)\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] VERY IMPORTANT!\n\u003e Learn Cisco Diagrams!!!!\n\ncertified mr wilson moment\n",

State the problem\n\n**Description**\n- The core idea of the program is a voice assistant targeted for high-school students as a useful tool in managing and optimising their work/study life on the computer.\n- I've titled the program **Ed's Voice Assistant**, as it is a voice assistant made by me.\n- The program is a personal tool app. It is not designed to be used for educational purposes, and while it caters for improving the education quality of high-school students, it does not directly provide education. It may also be considered an entertainment app, but its primary focus is as a digital tool to improve a user's interaction with their computer.\n- Once initialized, the voice assistant will listen to the user and execute a range of functions, such as opening Firefox, opening Obsidian (note-taking app), etc. There is also some quality-of-life functions for the program, such as closing the program.\n- As stated before, the target audience is students, as I feel that most students could use a voice assistant in terms of managing and further optimizing their computer usage, aiming predominantly for greater ease of use. \n- I aim to create a voice assistant that will allow increased productivity when using their computer for study or work. The target audience, myself included, wish to increase their personal productivity when studying, by eliminating repetition and tediousness that occurs regularly. \n\t- For example, when I am studying chemistry, I open Firefox, Obsidian and OneNote, and open textbooks I have on my computer. This takes valuable time, and reduces my overall efficiency when studying. I plan for my voice assistant to remove this inefficiency, by allowing custom commands, where if I were to say a key phrase, it would do all of these things at once, saving me crucial time.\n\t- In the future, I also plan for the voice assistant to be a general tool in the office, for example it could send emails to large batches of fellow colleagues. \n\t- Furthermore, people who have used voice assistants before may demand high quality in graphical design of the program. Using Tkinter, I plan to provide a well-thought-out visual interface, however **I have used copyrighted images (Siri logo) for parts of the visual design**, as I feel its simplistic design fits my program, and I admire the quality of the Siri voice asssitant.\n- The program will fill its user's need for a simplistic, easy-to-use voice assistant that will improve their productivity. It will also improve their quality of life, by helping its users achieve a healthy study schedule/routine.\n- The licencing used is the Permissive MIT licence, the reasoning for which is explained at the end of the Licencing section.\n\t- Having published the project to GitHub, anyone who wishes to modify my code through GitHub will automatically follow the licencing requirements of the MIT licence. Their programs should contain the original copyright notice and a copy of the original MIT licence.\n\n**Licencing**\nCurrently, there are 3 main software licences used by companies across the world:\n- *Permissive*\n\t- **Examples:**\n\t\t- BSD licences (family)\n\t\t- MIT Licence\n\t\t- Apache Licence\n\t\t- ISC Licence\n\t\t- JSON Licence\n\t- Permissive licences are a kind of free-software licence, which means it is allows users to run the program the licence is attached to, analyse the code of the program, and most importantly redistribute modified version of the program under whatever licence fits. This essentially allows developers to configure a program how they see fit, and release their new program under a new licence.\n\t- Permissive licences are also very compatible with other licences, due to its minimal restrictions on the user.\n\t- *It should be noted that a crucial flaw with Permissive licences is that they do not guarantee the type of licence of derivative software, and thus can result in derivative programs that are not free or publicly available.*\n\t- There are a few requirements for users of a program under a permissive licence, if they wish to redistribute the software:\n\t\t- They must leave in the original copyright notice.\n\t\t- They must leave the initial licence text of the program, such as the one shown below:\n```yaml {title=\"MIT License text\"}\n\n_Begin license text._\n\n---\n\nCopyright \u003cYEAR\u003e \u003cCOPYRIGHT HOLDER\u003e\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n---\n\n_End license text._\n\n```\n- *Copyleft*\n\t- **Examples:**\n\t\t- GNU General Public Licence\n\t\t- GNU Lesser General Public Licence\n\t\t- Mozilla Public Licence\n\t\t- Open Software Licence\n\t\t- Microsoft Reciprocal Licence\n\t- Copyleft licences are considered generally quite restrictive, and require that the same established rights in the license of the initial software remain in any derivate programs. However, Copyleft licences are still considered relatively open-source, as like Permissive licences, they grant many user freedoms, such as:\n\t\t- Right to perform/display, i.e. the right to use/display the program in public\n\t\t- Right to modify\n\t\t- Right to distribute\n\t- However, compared to Permissive licences, Copyleft licences do not allow users intending to redistribute modified software to include sublicences. In general, Copyleft licences also stipulate that redistributed version of software must keep the source code available to recipients of the new software. Furthermore, any derivative version must have the same licence as the initial software.\n\t- **The core difference between Copyleft and Permissive licences is that Copyleft licences require that any derivate programs contain the same licence.**\n- *Commercial/Proprietary*\n\t- **Examples**\n\t\t- There are no examples of public licence for Proprietary and Commercial software, as in general companies create specific legal agreements between them and users.\n\t- Proprietary/Commercial licences are some of the most restrictive licences available for software.  Minimal amounts of users are usually given, such as rights to use and display the program. However, the use of software under Proprietary or Commercial licences are usually highly restrictive.\n\t\t- For example, Adobe licences used to be limited to one users, i.e. they could only be used on one computer at a time.\n\t- Commercial and Proprietary licences are generally considered *closed-source*, as most Proprietary and Commercial programs are distributed in their **compiled form**, compared to **source code**.\n\t- In general, Commercial and Proprietary licences also heavily restrict the redistribution of software. Where source code is available, some Proprietary and Commercial licences also restrict the distribution of modified source code.\n\n*Having research many software licences, I have settled on using the MIT licence for my program. I believe this licence reflects my desires for the use of my program, as I hope that others can take the program and improve on it for their own use. I also believe that if their version of my voice assistant is both unique and helpful for others, that its developers should be able to relicense it.*\n\n**Resources**\nThe program is Python based (Python 3.10), and relies on text files to store data. The program also requires a lot of modules for its basic function:\n\n*Modules:*\n| Module Name        | Purpose                       | Importance          |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| tkinter            | GUI Design                    | Essential           |\n| pyttsx3            | Outputting voice              | Essential           |\n| speech_recognition | Recognising user input        | Essential           |\n| PIL                | Getting images                | Moderate Importance |\n| atexit             | Running code when script ends | Moderate Importance |\n| fileinput          | Closing text files            | Low Importance      |\n| sys                | Debugging in console          | Low Importance      |\n| time               | Getting time for the user log | Low Importance      |\n| Open Ai            | Does cool commands for user   | Essential           | \n\nThere is minimal equipment requirements for the creation and development of this program. I used a relatively high-end Dell XPS-15 and Visual Studio Code for the development of the software. However, I had to install Python 3.10, and also all the modules listed above through PIP installation.\n\nFor Visual Studio Code, I had the *Pylance* and *Python* modules installed. *Pylance* offers **rich type information**, i.e. gave suggestions for minor things for code, e.g. parameters, while the *Python* module allowed me to run and write the code in Visual Studio Code.\n\nI also used multiple sources of documentation for the various libraries for the program, such as Python Tutorial's website(https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/), Tkinter documentation in Python(https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), the official documentation of pyttsx3(https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.\n\nIn terms of skills and expertise, I have moderate skills in Python coding. I have a strong understanding of how functions work, which prove incredibly important for managing the structure of the program (having a main function, having a function that takes user voice input, having a function that speaks, etc.). Furthermore, through a strong understanding of lists, dictionaries and the use of text files in Python, I was able to store user data in a text file, and log all user interactions with the program in another file.\n\nI decided to log the actions of the program, as I felt that this would prove quite helpful as a means of gauging errors in the. However, I did not get to be able to log the change in variables present throughout the program, which means the logs will most likely be unhelpful for fixing logic errors.\n\nVisual Studio Code was my main source of testing for the program. Through its debugging menu (F5), I initially worked on the raw main.py file. I did so because when I pressed the Run Python File button, it did not access the text files. Later on while working on the project, I realised that I needed to open the folder the program was in, and from then I started using the Run Python File button, as it was easier to use.\n\nI also used Stack Overflow as a source of advice in using complex/badly-designed modules, such as Tkinter. For example, I initially had a problem with creating a function which would create multiple buttons of the same function, but with different parameters. I had difficulty fixing this issue, as I found that when the program started up, all the buttons were essentially pressed once, and would be unusable after. \n\n```yaml {title='Button Code'}\nfor i in accountdata:\n\n        button = ttk.Button(text = str(i))\n\n        button['command'] = finduser(i)\n\n        button.pack()\n```\n/* Note that the \"finduser\" function is a separate function.\n\nHowever, after looking up this issue with Tkinter on Stack Overflow, I discovered that when Tkinter parses through the 'command' section, it interprets the brackets as calling the function, and immediately calls the function, while incorrectly parsing the function, making it un-callable by the user.\n\nI also learnt from Stack Overflow to instead use Python's lambda functions.\n\n```yaml {title='Improved Button Code'}\nfor i in accountdata:\n\n        button = ttk.Button(text = str(i))\n\n        button['command'] = lambda i=i: finduser(i)\n\n        button.pack()\n```\n\n**Similar Products (samples)**\n- *Alexa*\n\t- Amazon's Alexa excels in its compatibility with many operating systems, such iOS and Android. It also has numerous unique commands, and even includes voice commands that can change settings. I have considered using voice-activated commands to change settings, but I feel there is simply not enough settings to change, and it would be redundant. Furthermore, as the program is a python file, it is generally incompatible with most computers, considering the amount of modules it relies on.\n- *Google Assistant*\n\t- Google Assistant's greatest quality is its voice recognition software, which is some of the best in the world. However, through Google's text-to-speech module in Python, my voice assistant should have the same recognition capabilities. Stylistically, Google Assistant has a simplistic, colourful design, which I have been inspired by. The design of Google's voice assistant focuses on user interaction, in its friendly voice and extensive utility as a general assistant. I am able to use Google's text-to-speech via its Python module\n- *Siri*\n\t- Apple's Siri is a very versatile voice assistant. It has limited settings, and is not very compatible compared to other well-known voice assistants. However, in terms of languages available, Siri is quite compatible, supporting up to 21 languages as of April 2021. Siri is mostly designed for mobile uses, which is why it is the most popular voice assistant for mobile devices. Unfortunately, as my program is written primarily in Python, and requires a lot of Python modules, it is incompatible for mobile use. However, I hope to design a voice assistant with much more basic voice commands than Siri, and my idea of customised voice commands give my program an advantage over Siri.\n2. Plan and Design\n\n**Screen Layout**\nInitial Layout:\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220912213050.png)\n- I've intentionally moved it off to the corner. I feel that voice assistants should be subtle in their location, and having it stuck in the middle would be confusing and weird for the user to use. \n- I personally worked on the design for the favicon logo and the central logo for the program.\n\t- The design features the logo of Siri, with inverted colours, surrounded by 1 thick circle and 2 thinner circles, under a chromatic background, with a plus symbol in the bottom right corner.\n\t\t- The reasoning for the Siri logo is because Siri is a popular voice assistant, one which I am inspired by in its accessibility and ease of use.\n\t\t- I feel the chromatic background will appeal to younger audiences, as it gives a sense of modernity. In doing so, I've attempted to entice young high-school students into using my program.\n\t\t- The plus sign is found in other projects of mine, as an inside joke.\n\t\t- The circles surrounding the Siri logo add a sense of modernity and class to the logo.\n\nTurning on the Program:\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220912213713.png)\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220912213732.png)\n- Here I've decided to use 2 windows, as otherwise I would have run into issues with removing the central logo image of the initial window.\n- I've included a little bit of code that **scales the height of the second window, relative to the number of accounts stored in the program**, so that the window can accommodate for as many account as can fit on the screen.\n\nUser Selected\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220912214816.png)\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220912214114.png)\n- I create a function, the \"boxstatus\" function, specifically for changing the text of the window. It also logs the change in the \"userdata.txt\" file.\n\nMain Voice Input Section\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020220915213632.png)\n- At this point, 2 new windows are created, one as a guide for new users on how to properly use my program, and one input box for the OpenAI API key necessary for the program to run. This is because I cannot leave my own API key in the code, due to the copyright of OpenAI's API, and thus I decided to input it. \n- The design of the new 2 windows are very minimalistic, like the original window. I've chosen to just leave the windows in their standard Tkinter design, while including the logo of the program. I did so as I feel that design is not the main focus of the program, and furthermore due to time constraints I considered it unwise to try and add more stylistic features to the windows.\n\n**Graphics**\n- The program features *very* *minimalistic* graphics. This is because I felt it would be too much of a challenge to use and improve on the basic Tkinter graphics. Furthermore, I feel the simplistic design of the logo makes up for the lack of visual dynamics and contrast in the graphical interface of the program. \n- I intended to use minimalistic graphics, as I believe that **the focus of a voice assistant should not be it's aesthetic beauty, but rather its functionality**. In using less engaging graphics, I hope that students will not be distracted by the program, and rather use the program to further improve their focus and productivity.\n\n**User Interface**\n- The user has 2 ways of interacting with the program:\n\t- Voice\n\t\t- The fundamental utility of the program is that one can use their voice to maximise the functionality of their computer usage. The program clearly indicates when it is listening for audio input, with the text box changing and an audio cue being played. \n\t\t- This interface is a crucial element of the program, as it fulfils the core purpose of the software. \n\t- Peripheral input (mouse)\n\t\t- For trivial things like starting the program and choosing an account, I decided to use Tkinter buttons for these things, as I felt they were not worth implementing voice commands, however for future designs of the program this should be implemented. \n\n**Algorithms: Flowcharts**\n\n![](000_Files/Untitled%20Diagram.png)\n\n![](000_Files/voice%20command%20flowchart%201.png)\n![](000_Files/account%20creation%20flowchart.png)\n\n**Algorithms: Pseudocode**\n```yaml {title='Voice Command Code'}\n# Note all the notequal signs are ! + = signs.\nBEGIN\nExit \u003c- \"False\"\n# program only breaks when given voice command to\nWHILE Exit != \"True\"\n\tOUTPUT(\"Listening\")\n\tINPUT(command)\n\t# following IF-ELSE statements refers to inbuilt functions\n\t# note the \"What would you like to do?\" string is repeated, to indicate to the user the program is repeating.\n\tIF command == None THEN:\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"Failed to understand, will try again.\")\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"What would you like to do?\")\n\tELIF \"obsidian\" IN command THEN:\n\t\topenObsidian()\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"What would you like to do?\")\n\tELIF \"Firefox\" IN command THEN:\n\t\topenFirefox()\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"What would you like to do?\")\n\tELIF \"close\" IN command THEN:\n\t\tcloseProgram()\n\t\tExit = \"True\"\n\tELSE:\n\t\t# using OpenAI\n\t\tkey \u003c- \"this is a working OpenAI key\"\n\t\tanswer = putThroughOpenAI(key)\n\t\tIF answer == None:\n\t\t\t# worst-case scenario, even OpenAi can't make sense of input \n\t\t\tOUTPUT(\"OpenAI didn't understand.\")\n\t\t\tOUTPUT(\"What would you like to do?\")\n\t\tELSE:\n\t\t\tOUTPUT(answer)\n\t\t\tOUTPUT(\"What would you like to do?\")\nEND\n```\n\n\n```yaml {title='Account Selection Code'}\n# Note all the notequal signs are ! + = signs.\nBEGIN\nINPUT(accountdata)\n# data taken from text file and put into list\nname \u003c- None\n# identifies whether no users\nIF len(accountdata) == 0 THEN:\n\tOUTPUT(\"No Users Detected\")\n\t# the following lines are the account creation code, simplified \n\tINPUT(name)\n\taccountdata[0] = name\n\tOUTPUT(name)\n# identifies whether only 1 user\nELIF len(accountdata) == 1 THEN:\n\tname = accountdata[0]\n\tOUTPUT(name)\n# in this case there are multiple users saved\nELSE:\n\tanswer \u003c- \"No\"\n\tcount \u003c- 0\n\t# while loop will ask user whether any of the user names saved are the desired one\n\tWHILE answer != \"Yes\" OR count == len(accountdata):\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"Is this your name?\")\n\t\tOUTPUT(accountdata[count])\n\t\tINPUT(answer)\n\t\tcount = count + 1\n\tIF answer == \"Yes\" THEN:\n\t# due to how Python lists work, count - 1 was used\n\t\tname = accountdata(count - 1)\n\t\tOUTPUT(name)\n\tELSE:\n\t\tOUTPUT(\"You chose none of them, let's try again.\")\n\t\tanswer \u003c- \"No\"\n\t\tcount \u003c- 0\n\t# note that there is no feature to directly add an account when accounts exist, in the actual program you must log into someone else's account, and create a new one from there\nEND\n```\n\n\n```yaml {title='Account Creation Code'}\nBEGIN\nINPUT(accountdata)\n# data taken from text file and turned into list\ncount \u003c- 0\nanswer \u003c- None\nname \u003c- None\n# while loop so users have 3 tries inputting name via voice\nWHILE count != 3:\n\tINPUT(nameAudio)\n\t# recognise.google is a function from a Python module\n\tanswer \u003c- recognise.google(nameAudio)\n\tIF answer != None THEN:\n\t\tname = answer\n\t\tcount = 3\n\t\t# this is done to escape the while loop\n\tELSE:\n\t\tcount = count + 1\nIF name == None THEN:\n\tINPUT(manualName)\n\t# this is physical input, i.e. typing it\n\tname = manualName\n\t# use of \"name\" variable so that manual and voice naming add to same variable\naccountdata.append(name)\n# adds name into text file\nOUTPUT(name)\nEND\n```\n\n3.

It is usually eaten for breakfast. |\n \n4. Evaluate\n\n**Survey**\n\nI have made a brief survey for my voice assistant consisting of 6 rating questions and 4 written questions, which was sent to my fellow peers in my Computer Science class. The following is a summary of the results, obtained from a sample size of 11.\n\nQuestion 1: \"On a scale from one to ten, how organised are you?\"\n- Average: 5.64\n- Comments: This average is quite shocking, and indicates that the target audience of the survey feel that they are unorganised. This could mean that they would gladly use productivity tools such as my voice assistant.\n\nQuestion 2: \"On a scale from one to ten, how important do you think productivity tools are?\"\n- Average: 8.09\n- Comments: This average indicates that the target audience of the survey feel that productivity tools are rather important. This could reveal a potential gap in the productivity tool industry, considering the appalling prior results. Yet, this average is relatively low, and could indicate an apathy towards productivity tools.\n\nQuestion 3: On a scale from one to ten, how busy are you, in general?\"\n- Average: 7.64\n- Comments: This indicates that people consider themselves to be relatively busy, which could mean that they would appreciate a productivity tool such as a voice assistant.\n\nQuestion 4: \"On a scale of one to ten, how often do you use a voice assistant?\"\n- Average: 4.45\n- Comments: This could mean that people are generally disinterested in using voice assistants, see them as ineffective, or that there has not yet been a voice assistant created that meets their needs.\n\nQuestion 5: \"On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate my program (any metric)?\"\n- Average: 8.6 (without outlier), 7.91 (with outlier)\n- Comments: From the high average, it's clear that the survey participants liked using my program. This could be due to user bias, or from genuine appreciation of the program's utility. I had to exclude a specific outlier from the results, as it was completely stood out from the rest of the results.\n\nQuestion 6: \"How would you rate the quality of the program's code?\"\n- Average Stars: 4.45\n- Comments: The survey participants were given a GitHub link to my program, and so were able to read the program's source code. Through either confusion or genuine analysis, the sample group returned a very high rating for the quality of the code, however it would be important to consider bias and the small sample size.\n\nQuestion 7: \"What do you like about the utility of the program?\"\n- Random Answer: \"It's useful in that it makes certain activities more effecient\"\n- General Sentiment: The program is useful and has a nice aesthetic\n- Comments: Despite personally thinking that the program has quite low utility, the survey participants gave quite positive comments. This could be a result of bias.\n\nQuestion 8: \"What do you dislike about the utility of the program?\"\n- Random Answer: \"It can be slow and not register my voice at times.\"\n- General Sentiment: Voice recognition is hard, the visuals could use some improvement\n- Comments: I think overall the comments were quite positive. I can't quite improve voice recognition, as it is currently based of Google's voice recognition, and I probably could've made it clearer that the design was minimalist in nature.\n\nQuestion 9: \"Do you have any suggestions on improving the program?\"\n- Random Answer: \"Use a better speech model perhaps?\"\n- General Sentiment: Get assistant to learn voices, more functionality, improve interface\n- Comments: These are all good constructive suggestions. If I had more time, I would have certainly worked on these pieces of advice.\n\nQuestion 10: \"Have you experienced any issues using the program? If so, please list them below.\"\n- Random Answer: \"It doesn't recognise my voice\"\n- General Sentiment: The program is slow, it struggles recognising voice\n- Comments: I suspect the slowness comes from the talking pace of the Google text-to-speech voice. This is an easy fix, and I could probably include this in some sort of settings window. As stated before, the voice recognition is out of my hands, and making something better than Google's voice recognition would be quite difficult.\n\nHere is the link to the survey: https://forms.office.com/r/UTPS0bchCd\n\n**Personal Evaluation**\n\nOverall, I consider this project to be a success. As someone who has only used raw Python when programming, I felt that having to learn how modules and specifically how GUI modules such as Tkinter work was quite challenging, yet rewarding as I progressed through the task.\n\nHowever, the task was quite tiring and due to time constraints, I was unable to maintain clarity and conciseness in the source code. I feel that there is quite a lot of inefficiency and redundancy in my source code, such as creating a function for specific windows, however I found this was the only solution at the time due to issues encountered with Tkinter.\n\nI think that while the voice assistant is relatively quite functional, in that it can in fact open specific programs and answer intrinsic questions through OpenAI, due to time constraints I was unable to implement custom functions, which was the main goal of the program. However, the inclusion of OpenAI does make up for this lack of features, as OpenAI's API is quite powerful, and can answer very hard questions such as \"What are 3 important things to remember when studying organic chemistry\" with responses such as:\n\n```yaml {title='OpenAI Response'}\n1. Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds.\n2. Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon atoms.\n3. Carbon atoms can form bonds with other carbon atoms, as well as with atoms of other elements.\n```\n\nThis detail in responses from OpenAI makes up for some of the lack of functionality, however I do consider my endeavours in creating a voice assistant with substantial utility not as successful as I had hoped.\n\nFurthermore, the following are some limitations I've derived from my program:\n- No custom commands\n- Account interface is quite redundant, and falls short of my idea to keep user-specific data stored.\n- OpenAI is necessary when it should be voluntary\n- Very little amount of actual features\n- For some reason the text boxes don't align even though its in their code, this is a trivial issue\n- No settings window\n\nHowever, there are also some good quality of the program:\n- Minimalistic design\n- Can open Obsidian\n- Can open Firefox\n- Can answer questions through OpenAI\n- Has an account system\n- Saves user data in text file\n\nIn summary, I feel that my project was a great effort in working in the shoes of greater voice assistants which were developed with a lot more funding(and incentive). As a result of time constraints, I fell short of the ultimate goal of a successful, well-designed voice assistant, yet the end product has a lot of potential and could be developed into a very user-friendly, intuitive program.",

There are unlimited wants, but limited resources. Furthermore, resources have alternative uses which have vary levels of efficiency.\n\t2. Limited resources and high demand.\n\t3. What to produce, how to produce, who to produce for.\n\t\n\t\n\ta. Depending on what is popular at the time, specific trends in fashion may be prioritized for production. E.g. if dresses are popular now, then producers may focus their resources on producing dresses.\n\tb. When available resources are scarce, producers may prioritize products that can be most efficiently made with their limited resources.\n\tc. in a weak local economy, consumers may produce cheaper products in greater qualities, so that their products become more affordable.\n\t5. Products that require intense labour tend to incur greater labour costs, so producers may opt to produce products that involve less labour.\n\t6. The Japanese economy is more service-centred, and also focuses on industries that do not require common natural resources, or wholly depend on imports (such as technology).\n\t7. China has an abundance of cheap labour and natural resources. This allows manufacturing costs to be cheap, as its abundance in labour and natural resources decreases the overall costs for production. This allows the products to be exported at a profit, which is why it is seen ass world producer\n\t8. \n\ta. \n\t1. New shoes\n\t2. Notebook\n\t3. Chemistry coursebooks (5)\n\t4. Lava lamp\n\t5.

You don't produce 300 tonnes of wheat.\n\t\t\tc. It depends on the market price of wheat and wool at the time. For both options, if the farmer wishes to maximise his profit, he should choose the level of production that maximises profit, given the current market price for wheat and wool.\n\t10. In order to increase funding for the war in Iraq, and to cut taxes for the rich, Bush would have to take money from the U.S. budget. This means that other sectors of the budget would not get money, such as infrastructure, education and healthcare.\n\t11. Labour-intensive refers to industries that rely on labour to produce goods. Capital-intensive refers to industries that rely on heavy machinery or capital investments to produce goods. Examples of labour-intensive industries include clothing, and accounting. Examples of capital-intensive industries include microchips and car manufacturing.\n\t12. Consumers' demand for a certain product will influence its value, as low demand results in consumers being less likely to pay high prices. This leads to consumers producing less of the product. For example, if it is revealed that coffee is extremely dangerous, then people are less likely to buy coffee, reducing demand, and subsequently the cost will increase. Furthermore, if coffee was revealed to be extremely healthy, people would buy more of it, and the demand would increase, increasing the price as producers increase production.\n\t13. The government may use their budget to purchase from specific industries, increasing the demand and value of said industries. For example, if the government were to invest in more mining sites, this would increase the amount of capital in the mining economy, allowing the potential for greater demand.\n\t14. The financial cost of a desalination plant would be the actual capital cost to build and maintain a desalination plant. However, the opportunity cost is the financial cost to the government for not investing the financial cost elsewhere, in industries such as healthcare.\n\t15. a. Computer.

They **buy goods and services from firms**. Firms require capital to do things, buy capital from other firms, etc.\n\t- Government employment is spending, generating income which goes to the households.\n\t- Governments can **change how much they spend**. \n- Export/Imports exists.\n\t- Exports: something you sell overseas.\n\t\t- When sold to foreigners, we get expenditure, which becomes our income\n\t- Imports: something we buy overseas\n\t\t- We send expenditure overseas, which becomes income for foreigners.\n\t- In Australia, our exports/imports are roughly balanced.\n\t\t- But currently we have a trade surplus, i.e. **we export more than we import**.\n\n**All expenditure in economy becomes income (of someone else)**\n- You buy some, i.e. you expend, and someone gets your money as income, i.e. from household to firm to household.\n**This is equal to the value of the output of an economy**\n\nBTC represents ==*fluctuations in the level of economic activity over time in an economy*==. \n\nSometimes, an economy produces less/more output. Either way, output relates to our income. \n\nPurpose of government (meeting economic objectives) is to have **household income always increasing**.\n- Thus we must **increase output**, as they are both equal\n- GDP thus must also increase. So when governments try to increase GDP, they aim to increase household income.\n\nGDP, Aggregate expenditure, and Aggregate Demand are essentially the same\n- For Aggregate expenditure\n\nInvestment: expenditure on capital equipment by firms(?)\n- New factories, new machinery, etc.\n- Expanding ability of economy, expanding capacity, is not a bad thing!!!\n\nFirms have **inventory**. Shops hold inventory, and each day a certain amount of stock will be sold, and then it will be topped up.\n\nPlanned investment: factory plans to produce a specific number of goods which they predict will be consumed.\n\nEveryday there is a planned **level of production**.\n\nWhat if there is an increase in the income of consumers?\n\nMaybe then, the amount of goods sold increases.\n\nThis is outweighed by their planned investment, and thus they will not keep up with demand. They will eventually run out.\n\nThis results in **unplanned investment**, as then the shop asks the factory to increase production.\n\nThis increases output, and thus GDP increases.\n\nIn some cases, such as this, expenditure is greater than income, as more people buy than there is to be replenished.\n\nShops take things out of their stock to sell, i.e. use their savings.\n\nRecall: *Aggregate Demand*.\n\nThe government can rapidly create jobs via government spending. This results in increased output.\n\nIn booms, government spends less money.\n\nThis is **fiscal policy**.\n\n**Aggregate Demand**: Total demand in an economy, of all consumers, business, government and net export. Governments can **change** this demand.\n\n**Aggregate Supply**: Total amount of output in an economy, coming from *firms* and from *imports*.\n\nWhat does it look like if inventories were decreasing?\n- Aggregate demand must *exceed* aggregate supply.\n\nWhat if inventories were increasing?\n- Aggregate **supply** must *exceed* aggregate demand.\n\nIn our economy right now, aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, due to supply chain issues.\n\nWhat should the government do to stabilise the government?\n - Tax more!!! :)\n\nGovernment is **spender, not supplier**.\n- It cannot produce more things to directly increase aggregate **supply**.\n- Instead, it increases its **own** demand/expenditure, to influence the economy's own *aggregate demand*.\n\n\n\n\n",

Don't lose marks for getting it wrong.**\n- What is aggregate demand?\n\t- **Total** demand in an economy\n\t\t- If you demand something, it doesn't mean you can get it.\n\t\t- Who demands? Households through consumption, firms through investment, government through government spending, and export sector. (**Net exports = exports - imports**)\n\t- Total **output** in an economy.\n\t- *What happens when aggregate demand is greater or lower than aggregate supply?*\n\t- Components of aggregate demand:\n\t\t- Consumption Expenditure - Consumption\n\t\t\t- Spending by **consumers - every person in economy, including firms, government, etc.**\n\t\t\t- Durable goods, e.g. houses\n\t\t\t- Non-durable goods, *lasts 3 years or less* e.g. perishable food\n\t\t\t- Services, e.g. education\n\t\t\t- 60% of aggregate demand.\n\t\t- Investment Expenditure\n\t\t\t- Spending on capital, e.g. machinery, **factories** and anything that can produce thing, which will produce goods and services in the future.\n\t\t\t- Refers to business and housing investment or inventories\n\t\t- Government Expenditure\n\t\t\t- G1: current (consumption) expenditure which are part of the day to day functions of government.\n\t\t\t\t- This refers to the set budget for the upkeep of the services/goods it provides.\n\t\t\t\t- e.g. There is a daily payment to the school for it to continue its servicing of education.\n\t\t\t\t- This usually cannot be changed.\n\t\t\t- G2: capital (investment) expenditure to provide for future needs such as schools, roads, etc.\n\t\t\t\t- Government invests money into improving existing goods/services or providing new things.\n\n**Fiscal policy is when government changes G2 to boost or lower economic activity. G1 is essentially constant.**\n\n**Aggregate Demand curve: how to change it**\n- Taxation - income changes, changing consumption\n- Interest Rates\n- Changes in supply\n- Deregulation?\n- Government spending\n- Immigration\n- Trade policy\n- Wage changes\n- Everything here is something to do with consumption, investment or government.\n- This is because anything that changes these things change aggregate demand\n- To move the curve, we must change these factors.\n\n**What is aggregate supply?**\n- The **total** amount of goods and services produced in an economy at a given price level over a given period of time. It is essentially the sum of all the supply curves of individual producers\n- This is exactly the same as GDP, as GDP measures value of output, which is essentially the same\n- We strive to be at equilibrium, where **aggregate supply** = **aggregate demand**\n\t- It's not bad or good, its simply when the 2 things are equal.\n\t- You can have equilibrium in both depression and boom.\n- An economy will never be at equilibrium, as there are too many everchanging factors.\n- However, our economy is trying to be at equilibrium.\n- Currently, aggregate demand is exceeding aggregate supply.\n\t- This means the producers cannot produce everything that people want.\n\t- This causes the price of the products to increase.\n\t- As the **price level** rises, demand will decrease as *people cannot afford it*. This is called the **income effect**.\n\t- Eventually, through price levels, we reach a point of \"equilibrium\" in a sense where aggregate demand reduces to the point where it meets aggregate supply.\n\t- The opposite applies, when we increase supply of a goods to match aggregate demand, prices will fall as we reach a point where aggregate demand reach a point.\n\t- **TLDR; Markets always move towards equilibrium, but will never get there due to imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.**\n\n- *Aggregate Supply curve* is the relationship between aggregate supply and the general price level.\n- Aggregate supply is total amount of goods/services produced, but does that mean the economy is at full capacity?\n- No! This is why the aggregate supply curve exists, the change in aggregate supply represents capacity utilization.\n\nNote: when supply curve moves to left, this is called a **supply shock**.\n- Increasing capacity translates curve to right, decreasing capacity translate curve to left.\n\n==Fiscal policy is **demand-side**!!!==\n\n***Aggregate supply can increase, but it does so if:***\n- Labour or capital increases\n- New technologies are adopted\n- Productivity increases\n- Price for key natural resources falls =\u003e This is a massive issue, and usually causes supply shocks.\n- Wage expectations fall\n\t- It will shift left if a supply shock occurs.\n\nFiscal policy's purpose is to maintain stability in an economy via impacting economic activity, and to meet the government objectives.\n\n### Fiscal Policy (finally)\nThe purpose of fiscal policy is to affect the level of economic activity, and meet the government's economic projections/objectives.\n- It also aims to affect resource allocation and income distribution.\n\n**Budget**: statement of *expected* revenue and *expected* expenditure over the financial year.\n\nWhen budget is written, the parts for G1 things are pretty accurate, as they have good enough data on the things already. However, things like **unemployment benefits** are usually inaccurate, as this could be changed by changes in the economy. \n\n\n\n",

In Australia's case this is the *Reserve Bank of Australia*, which is **independent** from the government.\n\t- Counter-cyclical: Go against the current direction of the BTC\n\t- Demand side: This impacts **aggregate demand** in a macroeconomy.\n- This is done to solve the main issue in economics, *inflation*.\n- Every country suffers from inflation, as there exists supply chain issues which cause inflationary pressures.\n- But ***difference countries deal with it differently***. \n- e.g. Turkey didn't raise interest rates, therefore their economy is bad (not really, but it is now :( )\n- In comparison, Australia has recently increased interest rates, to reduce demand and decrease inflationary pressures.\n- The **main tool** of monetary policy is the **cash rate**, the interest rate of the *Reserve Bank of Australia*, **OR** the rate they charge banks in the overnight money market.\n- The **PRIMARY PURPOSE** of the RBA is *price stability*, by keeping inflation **in check**.\n\t- The overall aim of Monetary Policy is to contribute to the macroeconomic stability of the economy. Whilst the primary focus is price stability, Monetary Policy is also concerned with economic growth and employment.\n- In others words, \"to **meet the inflationary target of 2-3%**.\"\n\n### Objectives of Monetary Policy\n- Stability of the currency\n\t- The objective is interpreted to mean low and stable inflation\n\t- Inflation: **The general rise of level of prices of the goods and services that households buy.**\n\t- Low and stable inflation *preserves the value*, or purchasing power, of money over time.\n\t- Australia has a **flexible medium-term inflation target, which is to keep consumer price inflation between *2-3%*, on average, over time.**\n- Full employment\n\t- This objective relates to the Reserve Bank promoting an environment that supports full employment.\n\t- Full employment: **where there are enough jobs for people who are available and want to work.**\n\t\t- Even at full employment, some people might be unemployed because of skill mismatches or as they move jobs. It is essentially impossible to have everyone employed, so RBA works towards the unemployment target of 4-5%.\n- Economic prosperity and welfare\n\t- This objective relates to the Reserve Bank promoting an environment that supports the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\n\t- This is primarily achieved by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment\n\n### Transparency:\n- The RBA's decisions about monetary policy are expressed publicly, to ensure accountability. \n\t- It gives the business community **confidence**, and allows them to make informed decisions on their business actions.\n\t- It gives consumers confidence, as consumers can plan for things, e.g. cash rate changes.\n \n### Types of Monetary Policy\n- Expansionary\n\t- Trying to *expand the economy*. Here, we are **lowering** interest rates.\n- Contractionary\n\t- Trying to *contract the economy*. Here we **increasing interest rates.** ==We are doing this right now!!==\n\t- e.g. Q: What is the current stance on monetary policy: A: **Contractionary**.\n\t\t- What is contractionary policy: Trying to increase the cash rate to induce a contractionary phase in the BTC.\n\t\t- **What is the current cash rate?** Look this up before the test.\n\t\t\t- Say this is ***aggressive***.\n- Neutral\n\t- They do nothing, but *sometimes it can still be contractionary/expansionary*. However, if GDP growth stays at one point for a long time, it is considered **neutral**.\n\n## Transmission of Monetary Policy!!\n- The **transmission mechanism** is the *process* undertaken to **increase the cash rate**. It occurs in step!\n- 1st Step: Must raise or lower the cash rate. The RBA will raise or lower the cash rate. \n\t- **NOTE:** One of the weaknesses of monetary policy is that other banks don't *have to listen to* RBA.\n\t\t- It has some ways to make other banks to follow, but it can't directly order them.\n- 2nd Step: Other interest rates **change as a result**, but are not *forced to*.\n**Complex steps:**\n1. RBA changes cash rate. Usually by half a percent. Sometimes by a full percent. For example, if we want contractionary policy, we will increase the cash rate.\n2. Transmission Channel No 1: Consumers *must borrow money*, to buy big-ticket items. When cash rates increases, people are less incentivised to buy things, e.g. houses. This reduces demand for item, meaning their prices fall. Thus, Channel No 1 is the **consumption channel**, and its really important as this *influences consumers*. If demand for a product increases too much, increasing the cash rate decreases the demand for this product. Furthermore, for houses, decreasing demand results in **reduced labour**. Thus, the consumption channel can have a **big impact**. Same thing applies with cars, e.g. people who make cars lose business.\n\n\n",

This is an expansionary monetary policy, as it aims to increase demand for goods and thus increase economic activity.\n\nHowever, as the effects of the pandemic waned, the RBA introduced higher interest rates, to also combat the housing crisis. Recently, the RBA has increased the cash rate going from 0.10% in 6th April 2022 to 2.35% in 7th September 2022. This is an example of contractionary monetary policy, as the RBA intends to make it harder to borrow loans, reducing demand for high-value goods and services and thus decreasing economic activity. This\n\nThe initial drop in cash rate was a direct response to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused stagnation in the macroeconomy. However, as lockdowns ended and economic activity skyrocketed, numerous crises such as the cost of living crisis and the housing crisis required the RBA to increase interest rates, and reduce aggregate demand. In doing so, the RBA engaged in contractionary policy to keep inflation low. This was done to keep inflation rate low, and eventually reach a 2-3% range.\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Econ Class 16\n\n## The Transmission of Monetary Policy\nThe RBA changed cash rate, which influences interest rates.\n\nThe change in **interest rates** translates through an economy. This is what we analyse.\n\nIt is transmitted through 3 main channels:\n- Consumption/Saving and Investment\n\t- When RBA **raises** cash rate, the banks (Commonwealth, ANZ, etc.) will raise interest rates, *on savings and loans*. They can only change interest rates for savings and loans. \n\t- This changes **new savings/loans!!!**\n\t- 2 Types of loans:\n\t\t- Household loans, things to buy a house/car\n\t\t- Business loans, loans for businesses for investment\n\t- This is why its called savings and investment channel, as loans tend to be considered for investments.\n\t- Increasing cash rates, mean interest rates increase. This means borrowing money costs more, and thus people are less inclined to borrow.\n\t- You can get fixed rates for mortgages, but have some inclusions (e.g. the interest rate for this is higher than the current variable rate)\n\t- There is a profit margin, i.e. even if the cash rate is 0.1%, banks will still have variable rate of 2-3%, as this is how they make money.\n\t- When you save, the money goes in a bank, which is loaned out at a higher rate than your savings interest rate. \n\t- Thus, when cash rate increases, savings increase while loaning decrease.\n\t- Thus, aggregate demand decreases as people tend to save their money rather than loan to buy things like houses.\n- Wealth\n\t- How to increase wealth: buy property, or shares.\n\t- When cash rate is increased, interest rates are increased, and then the demand for housing is decreased as it costs more to buy a house. This leads to housing prices decreasing. Thus, the wealth of people who own houses **should decrease**.\n\t- It costs people more to buy houses. Thus, you might not buy an **existing house**, or build a new house. This leads to a fall in demand in housing. Thus prices fall. When prices fall, as people have their wealth in their house, their wealth also falls. Thus, as they have less wealth, they will consume less. This reduces aggregate demand.\n\t- In terms of shares, if consumption has fallen, that means that companies will sell less. Thus, profits will decrease, and thus the values of their shares have fallen. Thus, the wealth of people who own shares decreases, their demand decreases, and thus aggregate demand decreases.\n\t- Wealth is how much you own, your assets. Assets are in property and shares in companies. If the value of assets fall, so does wealth. When people have lower wealth, they cannot afford more things, and thus demand fall.\n- Cash flow\n\t- Deals with **existing debt**. If you previously have a mortgage and interest rates increase, then the interest rate for the mortgage tends to increase.\n\t- Mortgage repayments come out of income. Thus, when mortgage rates increases, then people with fixed incomes will have **less disposable income**. Thus, people have to spend less.\n\t- This will reduce aggregate demand.\n\n***THE GOAL OF MONETARY POLICY: TO CONTROL INFLATIONARY PRESSURE!!!!!***\n**Inflation Target Rate: 2-3%**\n**Economic Growth Target Rate: 3-4%**\n**Unemployment Target Rate: 4-5%**\n\nNO NEED TO DO EXCHANGE RATE CHANNEL!!!\n",

There are numerous indexes by which living standard can be measured, such as:\n- Class disparity\n- Poverty rate\n- Quality and affordability of housing\n- Hours of work required to purchase necessities\n- GDP\n- Affordable access to quality healthcare\n- Quality and availability of education\n- Incidence of disease\n- Infrastructure\n- National economic growth\n- Economic and political stability\n- Political and religious freedom\n- Environmental quality\n- Climate\n- Safety\n\n### Definition of Poverty\nA state or condition in which an individual or group lacks the financial resources required to achieve and maintain a minimum living standard\n\n\n### Guiding Questions\n1. How is poverty defined in Australia by the Australian government?\n\tPoverty can be described a either absolute or relative poverty.\n\t- Absolute poverty refers to being financially unable to afford basic requirements for living, such as food and shelter.\n\t- Relative poverty refers to being financially unable to afford to participate in the basic activities of a society. For example, a family in relative poverty may be able to afford food, shelter, etc., but unable to afford eating at restaurants regularly. They are not in *absolute poverty*, but compared to other individuals in their society they are in *relative* poverty.\n2. Is it defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics?\n\tIt is defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. For someone to be below the poverty line in Australia according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, they must earn less than $10 an hour.\n3. Identify the number of homeless people in each state, including information on each capital city.\n\tIn total, there are 116600 people considered homeless in Australia. As of 2016 there are:\n\t- 4979 homeless people in Sydney\n\t- 1721 homeless people in Melbourne\n\t- 2188 homeless people in Brisbane\n\t- 886 homeless people in Perth\n\t- 644 homeless people in Adelaide\n\t- 309 homeless people in Hobart\n\t- 825 homeless people in Darwin\n\t- 1599 homeless people in the ACT\n4.  Provide an explanation on how poverty levels have changed in Australia over the last 20 years.\n\tPoverty levels had been relatively static from 1999 to 2007, from 13.1% to 11.5% by 2003. It would rise dramatically as a result of Australia's boom year, ending at 14.4% by 2007. From 2007-08, the Global Financial Crisis and a pension increase resulted in a fall to 12.6%, and a rise to 13.1% by 2017.\n5. How many children are in poverty in Australia and what does it mean we say, 'Children in Australia are living in poverty?'\n\tPoverty rate for children followed a similar rate to the overall poverty level in Australia, but affects a much greater percentage of the population. After the Global Financial  Crisis it was only slightly decreased by increases in pensions, and would drastically increase to 17.7% by 2015-16, much greater when compared to the overall poverty level.\n\tWhen we say 'Children in Australia are living in poverty', we are referring to the appalling standards of living a significant proportion of children experience. Not all children in Australia live in poverty, but enough do to be of significant concern.\n6. What is the difference between poverty levels in different communities in Australia (Indigenous and non-indigenous)?\n\tPoverty rates for Indigenous Australians are particularly high. In 2016, the poverty rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians was around 31%. Furthermore, there is significant geographical variance for Indigenous Australian poverty, being concentrated general within the most remote, rural areas of Australia.\n\tFor migrant populations in 1966, the poverty rate was 9.8%, but when considering costs for housing this rate rose to 12.3%.\n\tThe female population in Australia makes up the highest share of individuals in poverty (53%). Notably, people with disability make up 37%, 2-parent households make up 34%, and those with a pension 23-28%.\n7. Evaluative: How effective is Australia's welfare system in tackling poverty.  Hint: think unemployment, pension, disability benefits.\n\t- For most of the past few years, the Australian people have been governed by the Liberal-National Coalition, which support more neo-liberal policies for welfare. The main objective of their policy was to minimise government intervention *through restrictive social security payment*. The government made welfare *the responsibility of corporations* instead of government.\n\t- Data shows the government's fiscally conservative agenda was not well implemented, with spending on welfare faculties increasing. This funding has been *directed to disadvantaged groups*. Australia's welfare system has *struggled with increased globalisation*, as power falls into the *unsteady hands of corporations*.\n\t- Australia's welfare system is built on the concept of welfare for the employed with benefits and social rights mainly guaranteed for wage earners. The welfare system brings residual support for struggling families.\n\t- A staggered change to the welfare system towards privatisation has been opposed by the economic situation Australia finds itself in. Australia's welfare system attempted to de-fund welfare advocacy groups, intending to reduce the autonomy of independent welfare-related groups. \n\t- A deregulation of the labour market was implemented, on the premise that minimum wage results in unemployment for under-skilled workers, alongside the idea of wages being higher than support packages for the unemployed, to incentivise employment.\n\t- Benefits were also cut according to fluctuations in real wages. The Liberal-National government worked to prevent dependency on the welfare system. This was done by gradually restricting access to services over time of usage.\n\t- A core part of the neo-liberal economic policy implemented was the concept of mutual obligation. In essence, neo-liberals believe in a difference between \"deserving\" poor and the \"undeserving\" poor, where the underserving poor are dependent on welfare not by choice, and thus deserve the support of the welfare system.\n\t- As a result of these changes, the Australian welfare state has been uprooted and changed over time. The results indicate moderate success, with a general increase in income over time. However, this increase in income may be affected by changes in inflation.\n\t- This is further backed by a general decrease in the poverty rule for Australia. With the Liberal-National Howard government commencing during 2007, the rate has fallen from 12.5% to 10.3% by the end of 2016.\n\t- However, while the policy lowered the general poverty rate, Indigenous Australians still find themselves at a greater risk of poverty, with a poverty rate of 26% by the end of 2016, more than double the overall rate.\n\t- The government was successful in reducing dependency on the welfare system. However, it requires a greater funding for client employment incentives. It needs to tackle inequities in a changing labour market.\n\t- In summary, the implementation of a neo-liberal agenda within Australia's welfare system has brought mild success in combatting poverty and stabilising poverty rates through turbulent global economic crises.\n\n### What causes poverty?\nThere are numerous global causes for poverty, such as:\n- Inadequate access to clean water\n- Inadequate access to quality food\n- Low job opportunities\n- Regional conflict\n- Inequality (in general)\n- Poor education/skills training\n- Climate change\n- Lack of infrastructure\n- Weak government support\n\n### Causes of poverty in Australia\nIn Australia, the **main cause** of poverty is **wealth inequality**. Recent economic issues such as the housing crisis also influence poverty.\n\n\n### Solutions to poverty in Australia\nGreater funding and expansion of Australia's welfare system could help lift people out of poverty. Furthermore, more fiscal/monetary intervention towards policy that makes critical goods such as housing more affordable can relieve some families of financial stresses.",

    "content": "# Econ Class 2\n\n### Adam Smith:\n- **Came up with the idea of the ==free markets==**\n\t- Freedom to produce and exchange goods and minimising the role of government interventions and taxations in the free market (he did see the government as responsible for the **education** and **defence sectors** of the country)\n- The **\"invisible hand\"** : forces of supply and demand, every person helps to create the best outcome for all. - looked at concept of supply and demand, said price would determine the output - supply and demand lead to best output\n\t- **invisible hand**: ==market determines outcome, with no government interference.==\n- **Gross Domestic Product**: before smith, wealth of nation was based **on gold**. If you had gold you're rich, if not poor. But smith thought this was inaccurate, because it did not account for all the products and services produced by people. He said wealth of nation was based on **the sum of its production and its commerce**.\n\t- Invented *a matrix(?)* to calculate a nation's wealth based on GDP\n- Other ideas:\n\t- **Opening market for domestic and foreign competition** - ==likes free trade, thought world was a global market and believed people should trade freely==\n- 18th century Scottish economist and philosopher\n\t- His first idea was in **1776**, published \"wealth of nations\" (book)\n\t- Ideas developed **during the industrial revolution**\n\n### David Ricardo:\n- His first idea was in 1817, published \"principle of political economy and taxation\"\n- At that time, the British empire was **importing goods** from its colonies, **converting them** to better goods and **exporting them**. Furthermore, inventions supported trade (steam engine, cotton loom etc.)\n\t- The British **created a competitive advantage**.\n- **Biggest contribution** was **trade**.\n\t- Came up with theory of **competitive advantage**\n\t\t- Understood that nations use resources **differently**.\n\t\t- Nations with same resources may produce a certain product with a lower **efficiency**\n\t\t- Nations/businesses should **specialise** in goods they produce **efficiently** and **trade** with nations that produce things that they **produce inefficiently**.\n\t\t- Countries can benefit from international trade by specialising in the production of goods for which they have a relatively lower **opportunity costs** even if they do not have an **absolute advantage.**\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Absolute advantage:** The ability for an entity to produce more of a good or a service than a competitor (assuming same resources+tech)\n```\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Competitive advantage:** The ability for an entity to produce a good or service at a *lower opporunity cost* than a competitor\n\n```\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Opportunity cost**: The real cost of the next best alternative (in the scale of preference) that is forgone in order to obtain more of something else.\n```\n- **Secondly, the Labour theory of value**.\n\t- Value (*price?*) of good should not be based on the compensation paid for labour, but on the total cost of production.\n- **Corn Laws (1815-1846)**:\n\t- Tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the UK.\n\t- Keep corn prices high to **favour domestic producers** and represent **British mercantilism**\n\t- Tariffs work to promote domestic production.\n\t\t- e.g. Lets say a car cost $2000 if produced in Australia, but $1900 if it was imported. Tariffs increase the cost of imports by imposing a tax. This would make the cost of the imported car relatively high, say $2100. Then, the domestically produced car would be move favourable, but at an expense to the consumer, as the prices actually go up.\n\t- The great famine forced a resolution, and the laws were repealed, as buying food for cheap in the global market is better than growing it yourself at a higher cost.\n\n### Robert Malthus (pretty irrelevant guy):\n- First idea in essay, \"an essay on the principle of production\"\n\t- Population would continue expanding until growth is stopped or reversed by disease, famine, war or calamity\n\t- Population growth will always tend to outrun the food supply that betterment of human and land is impossible without strict limits on reproduction\n- Idea debunked, we have an abundance of food thanks to technology, however food transportation leads to famine, as it costs too much to feed people across the world.\n- Context: Poor laws\n\t- Ensure people have access to **food**, **clothing** and **shelter**. But they had to work for it. However, population exploded.\n\t- Laws maintained from 16th century till after ww2.\n- The Malthusian theory of population made a strong and immediate impact on British social policy. It had been believed that fertility itself added to national wealth; the Poor Laws perhaps encouraged large families with their doles. \n\n### Karl Marx:\n- German economist\n- Most prevalent idea was \"the ==communist Manifesto==\" (1848)\n\t- Focused on the struggle between capitalists (owners of productive resources/factories etc.) and the working class. (**still ongoing today**)\n\t- Examines the effect of capitalism on labour, productivity and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to overturn capitalism in favour of communism. He felt this because there was a disproportionate number of capitalists to working class\n\t- Labourers: have **little power** in the capitalist economic system\n\t\t- Also exploited with **low wages**(**modern issue**) to maximise in profit\n\t- Communism as an economic concept:\n\t\t- Workers should become owners of factories and production. Workers have equal share in ownership of factory. This gives incentive to produce goods as best as possible, as they have a share in the profits. \n\n### John Maynard Keynes\n- British, came up with his idea in 1936 about ==economic intervention policies (government expenditure)==\n- Prominent economist during the great depression, believed government intervention could save the global economy\n- Macroeconomic theory of total spending in the economy and its effect on output, employment and inflation:\n\t- **Described GDP as c + i + g**\n\t\t- Before it was c + i, **consumption and investment**, now with g, **government spending**\n\t\t- At this time, there was great depression, but Keynes believed that the government could **spend** to combat **depression**.\n- Advocates for increased **government expenditure** and **lower taxes** to stimulate demand and **pull the global economy out of the depression**\n- Government investment can stimulate the private sector of an economy.\n",

    "content": "# Econ Class 3\n\n### John Maynard Keynes\n- Big thing was **government expenditure concept** - government should stimulate and invest in the economy\n- Believed only way out of the great depression was government expenditure.\n\n### Milton Friedman\n- American economist in 1962\n- Hated government interference\n- 1962 \"capitalism and freedom\" - **monetarism**\n\t- importance of monetary policy - control of the money supply in the economy by government controlling the supply of money that flows in the economy while allowing the rest of the market to fix itself (**promotes free market**)\n\t- supply should grow at nice consistent rate *(roughly 3 percent)*, then economy will grow at same rate. Production will rise alongside growth of economy, and will have no inflationary problems.\n```ad-note\n- interest rates = cost of money\n- inflation = prices of goods and services\n- money supply = notes/coins in circulation\n- Increase this at steady rate, and production of goods will increase also at steady rate. This will not lead to inflationary issues, as both factors increase in the same way.\n\n```\n- 1970 - massive inflationary pressures due to oil shocks.\n- **Keynes focus was on employment/expenditure. Friedman was about human incentives, prices, inflations. He wanted free market. He was big on governments not interfering.** -\u003e much like Smith\n\t- Friedman brought about a renewed emphasis on prices, inflation and human incentives, a direct counter to Keynes' focus on employment, interest and public policy.\n- To change individual consumption, **income must change** \n- Friedman's first big breakthrough in the field of economics was his Theory of the Consumption Function in 1957, which championed the idea that a person's consumption and savings decisions are more greatly impacted by permanent changes to income, rather than changes to income that are perceived as temporary. This theory produced the permanent income hypothesis which explained why short-term tax increases actually decrease savings and keep consumption levels static, all else being equal, (That is, people will draw down on their savings to maintain the level of consumption if taxes are increased).\n- If short term tax increase, people will **draw down on savings** to **maintain level of consumption**, *rather than reduce* level of consumption.\n- **Permanent** tax increases **will affect** level of consumption\n- Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. It is driven by **too much money**.\n\u003eThe most famous excerpt from Friedman's writings and speeches is, \"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\" He defied the intellectual climate of his era and reasserted the quantity theory of money as a viable economic tenet. In a 1956 paper titled \"Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money,\" Friedman found that, in the long run, increased monetary growth increases prices but does not really affect output.\n- Friedman's work busted the classic Keynesian dichotomy on inflation, which asserted that prices rose from either ”cost-push” or “demand-pull” sources. It also put monetary policy on the same level as fiscal policy.\n- **Both Keynes and Friedman are correct. Print money -\u003e inflationary pressures, while too much demand compared to supply also causes inflation.**\n\n### Fredrich von Wieser\n- Came up with marginal utility, and opportunity cost.\n- Cost of a commodity depends neither on the amount of money nor the amount of labour required in its production but rather on its subjective or psychological value.\n- Furthermore, Wieser contributed the theory of \"**impution**\", and thought what price actually means.\n\t- Price tells you the value of the commodity **relative to other goods and relative to your *demand for it***\n\t- Price has to some degree represents cost, however they also represent **market conditions** - how many people want the product, and how much of the product is available (supply and demand), relative to other products and their supply/demand.\n- Said a **socialist economy** would also require a **price system**.\n- Thought about scarcity, resource allocation and marginal utility.\n\t- Prices reflect what people want and how much satisfaction you get from them.\n### Fredrich von Hayek\n- Big on free market, contradicting Keynes\n- Believed prices of free market was greater indicator of what happens in the market.\n\n### **Thinkers in the Assessment**:\n- Adam Smith\n- David Ricardo\n- Keynes\n- Friedman\n- Karl Marx\n- **NOT** Wieser\n- **NOT** Hayek\n\n\n## Economic Systems\n- Milton Friedman was dealing with inflation, and how to get out of it\n- Keynes was dealing with great depression\n- Keynes/Smith was about indivudal revolution, and free market\n- Karl Marx was reacting to exploitation of workers\n- ALL concerned with how a system works, how its resources are divided\n\n==Philosophers:\nQ1: What they Do:\nQ2: Their contribution to a system\nQ3: Tie it together==\n\n- What is an economic system?\n\t- Refers to the way an economy organises itself to address the Basic Economic problem.\n4 questions for BEP:\n- **What to produce**\n- **How to produce**\n- **How much to produce**\n- **For whom to produce**\n\nHence government control used to solve the BEP depends on the type of economic system:\n- Free market\n- Planned (command)\n- Mixed (modified market)\n- Tradition (cringe and not relevant)\n*Smith - free market, Marx - planned, Keynes - mixed*\n\nMost economies require **a system** to address the 4 basic questions\n- A system where all the decisions are made by the government OR where markets are allowed to make decisions\n- Mixed is a little bit of both.\n\n- A decision made in the city can have a massive environmental impact on rural areas -\u003e Great famine, sparrow stuff\n\n- An economic ystem refers to the way an economy organises itself to address the BEP\n- An economic system is a system of production, resource allocation and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area.\n- It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community/society/country.\n==KEY CONCEPT OF A MARKET ECONOMY IS THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND==\n\n- A market economy is a system where the **laws of supply and demand** *direct* the production of goods and services\n- Supplies includes natural resources, land, labour and enterprise - Factors of Production\n- Demands include purchases by consumers, business and the government.\n- Businesses sell their wares at the highest price consumers will pay.\n- At the same time, shoppers **look for the lowest prices** for the goods and services they want.\n- Workers bid their services at the highest possible wages that their skills allow. \n- Employers seek to get the best employees at the **lowest possible price**\n- Equilibrium when what they are willing to sell is the same as when you are willing to buy\n- Unions are a response to when an individual has to negotiate with larger company. It allows people to control wages of a specific job and where competition can work together to advocate for better wages.\n\n**Market Economy characteristics:**\n- Private Property\n\t- One of the most important characteristics of a market economy\n\t- Most goods and services are privately owned\n\t- The owners can make legally-binding contracts to buy, sell or lease their property.\n\t- In other words, their assets give them the right to profit from ownership.\n\t- Important because gives **sense of security, and has the financial motivation to improve and increase efficiency of a property.** \n- Freedom of choice\n\t- You decide what you buy, sell and produce.\n\t- Most importantly, you operate in a **competitive market**.\n\t- There are 2 constrains:\n\t\t- First is the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. In truly competitive markets, the market will determine the price. You can't choose, or else you will not profit\n\t\t- Second is the amount of capital they have.\n\t- Motive of Self-Interest\n\t\t- People are driven by self-interest, want to sell products to highest bidder, and want to negotiate to buy things at the lower price.\n\t\t- This will lead to benefit for the economy in the long term.\n\t\t- Auction system sets prices for goods and services that reflect their market value.\n\t\t- It gives an **accurate picture of supply and demand at any given moment.**\n\t- Competition\n\t\t- MUST have competition in a market place.\n\t\t- **The force of competitive pressure keeps prices low. It also ensures that society provides goods and services most efficiency.**\n\t\t\t- When in competition, people work to be the best for the consumers.\n\t\t- As soon as demand increases for a particular item, prices rise thanks to the law of demand.\n\t\t- Competitors see they can enhance their profits by producing it, adding to supply.\n\t\t- This lowers prices to a level where only the best competitors.\n\t- System of Markets and Prices\n\t\t- A market economy relies on an efficient market in which to sell goods and market\n\t\t\t- This is realistically not true.\n\t\t- That's where all the buyers and sellers have equal access to the same information.\n\t\t- Price changes are pure reflections of the laws of supply and demand.\n\t- **Limited** government\n\t\t- The role of government is to ensure that the markets are open and working.\n\t\t- For example, it is in charge of national defence to protect the markets. It also make sure that everyone has **equal access to the markets. The government penalizes monopolies that restrict competition.** \n\t\t- It makes sure no one is manipulating the markets and that everyone has equal access to information.\n\t\t- Government should not interfere in government, should make sure market is efficient\n\nPlanned/Command Economy:\n- When a **central government makes all economic decisions**.\n- Either the government or a collective owns the land and the means of production.\n- ***It doesn't rely on the laws of supply and demand that operate in a market economy.***\n- In recent years, many **centrally-planned economies** began adding aspect of the market economy. The resultant mixed economy better achieves their goals\n- America has been introducing **supply-side economics** (related to command?), people don't learn from mistakes\n\nWhat happens?\n- The government creates a **central economic plan setting economic and societal goals** for every sector and region of the country\n- *The government allocates all resources according to this central plan*\n- People **must** work to follow this plan.\n- **It tries to use the nation's capital, labour and natural resources in the most *efficient way possible.***\n- It promises to use each people's skills and abilities to their highest capacity seeking to eliminate unemployment.\n- 1 Positive: 0 Unemployment!!!\n\nThe central plan:\n- Sets the priorities for the production of all goods and services.\n- These include **quotas** and **price controls**. Its goal is to supply enough **food, housing and other basics** to meet the needs of everyone in the country.\n\t- In a market economy, government uses other means to influence prices compared to price controls e.g. interest rate\n- It also sets national priorities which include mobilizing for war or generating robust economic growth.\n\nGovernment:\n- **The government creates laws, regulations, and directives to enforce the central plan**\n- Businesses follow the plan's production and hiring targets.\n- They can't respond on their own to free market forces.\n- Government owns monopoly businesses. These are in industries deemed essential to the goals of the economy.\n- These usually includes finance, utilities, and automotive.\n- *There is no domestic competition in these sectors.*\n\nThe command economy is a key feature of any communist society.\n- Cuba, North Korea and the former Soviet Union are examples of countries that have command economies.\n- China maintained a command economy for decades before transitioning to a **mixed economy** that *features both communistic and capitalistic elements,*\n\nMixed economy:\n- System that combines characteristics of market, command and traditional economies. Australia is mixed.\n- It benefits from the advantages of all three while suffering from few of the disadvantages.\n\n**Will have 3 of the following charac. of a market economy:**\n- Protect private property\n- Allows the free market and the laws of supply and demand to determine prices\n- It is driven by the motivation of the self-interest of individuals\n\n**Some charac. of command economy**:\n- It allows the central government to safeguard its people and its market.\n- The government has a large role in the military, international trade and national transportation.\n\n*The government's role in other area depends on the priorities of the citizens.*\n- In some the government creates a central plan that guides the economy.\n- **Other mixed economies allow the government to own key industries.**\n- These include aerospace, energy production, and even banking.\n- *The government may also manage healthcare, welfare and retirement programs.*\n\n```ad-note\n\nAustralia is considered to be a mixed economy because it is characterised by private enterprise coupled with strong regulatory oversight by government and the government provisions of public goods such as roads.\n```\n",

The relationship between government and the economy has been debated for a long time.\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition:\n**Economic Systems**: A social science that analyses the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. There are many different economic systems in the world.\n\n```\n**Compared to...**\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n\n**Economic Schools of Thought**: A group of economic *thinkers* who share a common perspective and belief on how economies work and how they should be run.\n```\n- Capitalism:\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n\nCapitalism: An economic system where means of production like factories, equipment, etc. are **private owned** rather than controlled by the government.\n```\nCapitalism(cont.):\n- Laissez-Faire\n\t- The idea that the free market, through **supply and demand**, will regulate itself if government does not interfere\n\t- Government should be *\"hands off\"* with big business.\n\t- Example: Rise of Industry in America in 19th century.\n- **Supply and Demand** (*not tested*)\n\t- The way a market regulates itself in a capitalist society.\n\t- Prices adjust because of what happens in the market, and are crucial to capitalism.\n\nStrengths of Capitalism:\n- **A warning!** - If governments own the means of production and set prices, it invariably leads to a powerful state and creates a large bureaucracy which may extend into other areas of life. This system doesn't work.\n- **Efficiency** - Firms in a capitalist based society face incentives to be efficient and produce goods which are in demand. These incentives create the pressures to cut costs and avoid waste.\n\t- If not, they will lose against firms that *are*. \n- **Innovation** - With Capitalism entrepreneurs and firms are seeking to create and develop profitable products. Therefore, they will not be stagnant but invest in new products which may be popular with consumers. This can lead to product development and more choice of goods.\n- **Economic Growth** - With firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative and work hard - creates a climate of innovation and economic expansion,\n- This helps to increase real GDP and lead to improved living standards.\n\n\tWeaknesses of Capitalism:\n- **Monopoly power** - Private ownership of capital enables firms to gain monopoly power in product and labour markets. Firms with monopoly power can exploit their positions to charge higher prices.\n- **Social benefit ignored** - A free market will ignore both positive and negative externalities. e.g. doesn't care about climate change, only profits.\n- A profit maximising capitalist firm is likely to ignore negative externalities, such as pollution from production, this can harm living standards.\n- Similarly, a free-market economy will under-provide goods with positive externalities, such as health, public transport and education.\n- This leads to an **inequitable** allocation of resources.\n- **Inherited wealth and wealth inequality** - A capitalist society is based on the legal right to private property and the ability to pass on wealth to future generations.\n- Capitalists argue that a capitalist society is fair because you gain the rewards of your hard work.\n- But, often people are rich, simply because they inherit wealth or are born into a privileged class. Therefore, capitalist society not only fails to create equality of outcome but also fails to provide equality of opportunity.\n- **Inequality creates social division** - Societies which are highly unequal create resentment and social division.\n\nCapitalism Pros:\n- Incentives to be rich, encourage innovation\n- Firms have incentives to be efficient\n- Consumers free to choose products they desire\n- Prevents large bureaucratic government\n- Better than alternatives\n\nCapitalism Cons:\n- Firms can gain monopoly power and exploit consumers\n- Firms with monopoly power can pay low wages\n- Externalities can damage the environment\n- Tends to lead to large inequality\n- Prone to 'boom and bust' economic cycles\n\n**Socialism**:\n- A political and economic theory that advocates **ownership of the means of production such as factories and farms by the people, rather than capitalists.** \n- Power is in the hands of the working class\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\nSocialism: Means of production are owned by the people, rather than the capitalists.\n```\n",

    "content": "# Econ Class 5\n\nStrengths of Socialism:\n- **Reduction of relative poverty** - A welfare state which provides a minimum basic income for those who are unemployed, sick or unable to work **maintains a basic living standard** for the poorest in society and helps to reduce relative poverty.\n- **\"Free\" health care** - Free health care at the point of use means everyone is entitled to basic health care. This increases the living standards of those who cannot afford to pay private doctors. By improving the nation's health it also contributes to increased labour productivity and higher economic growth in the long term.\n\t- Not actually free. Tax contributes to health care.\n\t- Compare countries? e.g. USA, Germany. In general, healthier nations are generally more productive, and will have more stable economic growth in the long run. In USA, the business cycle is more erratic. This may be because of health care\n\t- **Induced demand** - building more hospitals -\u003e people use hospital more frequently, demand is induced -\u003e more hospitals required.\n\t- *In the US, there is no universal health care and uninsured workers can slip through the net and either not be entitled to health care or go bankrupt trying to pay the bills.*\n- **In Denmark, starting pay at McDonald's is roughly $22 an hour. Workers get life insurance, maternity leave, a pension, and six weeks of paid vacation each year.**\n- **A more equal society is more *cohesive*** - A society which has equality of opportunity and limited inequality is likely to be more cohesive. If people perceive they live in a very unequal society - exploited by employers and earning significantly less than their bosses, it can lead to frustration and resentment. If everyone feels they have a fair stake in society, it can help create a more harmonious society where workers are committed to the success of the firm which they work for.\n- **Socialist values encourage selflessness rather than selfishness** - Capitalism **encourages attitude to make profit**, even at the cost of other individuals or the environment. A socialist society **does not pursue profit as its highest goal, but social cohesion and the common good**.\n- **Benefit of public ownership** - Companies can be run in the public interest rather than just for the benefit of shareholders. \n\t- For example, industries like railways and **education**\n- **Environment** - An economy which is regulated to work towards the long-term welfare will place a higher value on the environment\n\nWeaknesses of Socialism:\n- **Lack of incentives** - if an economy has **high rates** of **progressive taxation**, it could cause disincentives to work and setting up business. Entrepreneurs may feel that if the government is taking a high percentage of their profits, they would prefer not to take the risk or work abroad.\n- **Government failure** - In an ideal world, the government would be successful in regulating firms, labour markets and running public industries\n\t- However, government intervention is prone to government failure and an inefficient allocation of resources. For example, **labour market regulations such as high minimum wages could lead to unemployment and a lack of flexibility, which firms need to deal with a sudden increase in demand. If firms are highly regulated, it is an extra cost which may discourage investment and lead to lower economy growth.**\n- **Welfare state** - *it can cause disincentives* - If a welfare state is too generous, it is argued it may create a disincentive to get a job and therefore it can reduce the labour force and individual effort.\n- **Powerful unions** can cause *labour market antagonism*. ideally, socialism aims at a more harmonious society. However, if the socialist policies are geared towards strengthening trade unions and aiming for perfect inequality, it can lead to antagonistic labour relations with a \"them and us\" mentality - **workers against owners**. This attitude can *cause time lost to strike and unproductive factories.*\n\nSocialism Pros:\n- More equal society\n- Reduction of povety\n- Regulates excesses of free market - externalities, monopoly and monopsony?\n- Universal health care improves living standards and labour productivity\n- Promotes common good and social welfare rather than selfish aims\n- More equal society increases social cohesion\n- Can promote protection of environment\n\nSocialism Cons:\n- Higher tax reduces incentives to invest and work\n- Entrepreneurs may prefer to move tax havens abroad\n- Welfare state can create disincentives to work\n- Government failure in regulation and ownership of industry\n- Excess labour market regulation can lead to less employment and structural employment\n- Powerful unions cause antagonism between workers and owners.\n\n**Communism**:\n- An economic or political system in which the **state** or the community owns all property and the means of production (literally everything), and citizens own the wealth.\n- Classless society (theoretically)\n\nStrengths of communism\n- **Centrally planned economy** - It can quickly mobilize economic resources on a large sacle, execute massive projects, and create industrial power. it can move so effectively because it overrides individual self interest and subjugates the welfare of the general population to achieve critical social goals.\n- May of the leaders are in charge for life, even through they might not hold a title from monarchy. This structure makes it easier for the leadership to transform the economic vision of the country to what the person in charge wants.\n- **Equality** - on a level that capitalism can never offer - the idea of communism is that capitalist societies will eventually crumble because the weight of wealth on top of the poor will eventually cause the system to become top heavy.\n\n```ad-important\n\n**Economics is conceptual. It's about society, and how we solve problems**\n```\n\n- **Allows for employment opportunities** - to be given out to everyone - When you live under an authentic communist government, then anyone who wants a job will have one. If you don't like the idea of working, the you must support your community in some other way.\n\nWeakenesses of communism\n- Government **owns everything** - including property, business and production means.\n\t- This **eliminates the free market from domestic society** - no laws of supply and demand to set prices that consumers play\n\t- **Price mechanism allows people to adjust price to compensate for production**\n\t- **The needs of the consumer are not really met.**\n- This causes planners to lose the feedback they need to understand what is necessary for the production cycle and what could use an upgrade. There is no up-to-date information about what the needs of the consumers happen to be either.\n- Because of this disadvantage, it is not unusual for the government to produce too much of one item and too little of another. Surpluses and shortages in critical need areas can be strong enough at times that government disruptions can occur.\n- **Central planning** - Although the government can mobilize significant resources for almost any need at a moment’s notice through the structures of communism, there is *a difference between the ability to centrally plan and its overall implementation.*\n- Because a free market doesn’t exist under this structure, the citizens will setup **black markets to help them trade the items they want** or need that are not part of the planner’s provisions.\n\t- In Soviet union, Americans would go there to sell things on the black market.\n- This disadvantage destroys the trust that is found in the pure vision of communism. The goal is to give people what they need according to who they are as individuals.\n- Communism looks at each person as a resource, provides them a common set of basic essentials, and then expects compliance under the threat of further freedom restrictions.\n- **Efficiency and productivity** are *difficult* to achieve since there is *little motive for workers.*\n- There is **never a need to have entrepreneurs** operating in a communist space because the government maintains control of everything.\n- You produce at a **specific level**.\n- That means the production cycles operate just well enough to produce what is needed for domestic consumption and **the limited export market that may be available.**\n- Because *innovation is what pushes an economy forward*, shepherded by the development made possible by *entrepreneurs* who wish to experience success, the living situation in a country practicing this form of government can be exceptionally stifling.\n- **Poverty** – There is *a reason why only five active governments* in the world today practice communism. North Korea, China, Laos, Cuba, and Vietnam are transitioning from socialism and are not true forms of this government structure any more either.\n- China is the one exception to this disadvantage because of its *efforts to integrate some elements of capitalism or free markets* into its society.\n\t- They have **used capitalism** to **pull people out of poverty**.\n- For the other five countries that continue to use this governing structure, the result is a **higher level of poverty** than other nations. North Korea, Cuba, and Laos are struggling in particular because the first emphasis is to maintain the structure of the government. People are asked to get by on the bare minimum – and even that is not enough sometimes.\n- During a bout with famine in North Korea in the 1990s, an estimated 3 million deaths occurred because of the economic shortfalls and lack of resources.\n- Deaths peaked in 1997 from this issue.\n- Then the government cracked down on anyone who used the terms “famine” or “hunger” because it would indicate a failure on the part of the government to negate the issue.\n\n**Economic systems fall on a spectrum**\n- Absolutes are communism and pure competitions, and mixed economies are in between.\n- ",

This is the most important aspect of communism. The government is also **responsible for every productive aspect it must supply (?)**\n- Government owns all means of production\n- Government owns **everything**\n- There is no concept of a **price mechanism**\n- No sense of competition, goods are allocated to individuals in society\n\t- Everyone gets the same goods\n\t- Due to no competition, quality is generally lower\n- Goal is for **equality** for everyone, as enforced by the government\n\t- This is proven to be unlikely in communist states such as the Soviet union, where corruption is rampant.\n\t- **Biggest weakness** is *inefficiency*!\nIn real world socialism, there are **degrees** of socialism.\n- What aspects of Australia are socialist? \n\t- Quite a lot. The essential human goods and services are generally owned by the government, e.g. water corporation, western power etc.\n\t\t- However, these are under State jurisdiction. So these basic means of production aren't necessarily owned by the federal government, but by the state government\n- **Basic means of production are owned and managed by the government**\n\t- In Australia, there is huge private sectors, with some regulation.\n\t- *Private ownership, with regulation, of business*\n- **Cooperation is more important than competition**\n\t- Not in Australia. Competition is important, we want lowest price with highest quality.\n- **High standard of living and economic security**\n\t- Contrasted with Socialism. In European countries (Norway), they pay a lot of tax. \n- **High taxes provide free health care and education**\n\t- Medicare is socialised healthcare. In Australia, parents pay the **medicare levy**(3% of tax. income). Government sets price for every medical procedure available in Australia. The doctor can either charge the full price, or more. If they pay more, you pay the difference, but regardless, the government will pay you what the government has stated the price is.\n\t- Public hospitals come from state, and funded by both state and federal. When you go to hospital for healthcare, most of it is usually covered through medicare. e.g. cancer, *however*, this applies to everyone.\n\t- Private hospitals cost more, however the government will pay **their share of it**. \n\t\t- Britain has the NHS. It's essentially **all public**, in private hospitals, the government doesn't pay their share. However, in the public system the government will pay for essentially all of it.\n\t- Problem: **People will use it. An overload of people will lead to problems.**\n\t\t- Private system relies on people not being able to afford it.\n\t- *Private* health insurance: \n\t\t- Say we have 1mil people in society\n\t\t- Statistically, say 1k of these people will get ill (0.1%). \n\t\t- Average cost to fix people will be $1k per person ($1mil in total)\n\t\t- How to work out premium?\n\t\t- What this means, is that people pay a health insurance premium. It's what people pay to ensure they get health insurance.\n\t\t- Say everyone pays $1 dollar. Then the insurance can pay for everyone.\n\t\t- However, if more people get sick, say 4k people get ill now, that means **everyone's** premium goes to 4 dollar, and this escalates.\n\t\t- **health insurance funds** require *healthy people* to pay into the fund and **not use it**.\n\t\t- However, young people will start dropping **out of the funds,** as they have no need for it.\n\t\t- This leads to a rapid increase in the premium. \n\t- In Australian private health insurance, they made young people at the age of 30 and beyond, they will reduce their medicare levy. \n\t- If you get private health insurance by age 30, you will get discount on medicare.\n\t\t- Get private health insurance, reduce your tax.\n\t- When thinking about socialism, consider that free stuff means that government provides it through higher taxes.\n\n**Types of Economic Systems**:\n- Adam Smith promoted Cap\n- Keynes didn't necesarily promote socialism, but believed in some aspects\n- Karl Marx really liked communism.\n\n## Schools of economic thought:\n- Classical Economics (Classical Political Economy)\n- Keynesian Economics\n- Supply side Economics\n- Monetarism\n**There are the only ones in the test.**\n```ad-info\nThey relate to the economic **thinkers**. Schools of thought come from their **philosophers**.\n\n```\nThings to look into later?\n- Austrian School\n- Behavioural Economics\n\n**Classical Economics**\n- Classical economic theory was brought into the mainstream by Scottish economist **Adam Smith**\n\t- Big thing: **hated government interference in the market**\n\t\t- Believed that market could sort out any problem\n- Free trade good!! :)\n- Coincided with the *industrial revolution*\n- Many fundamental economic theories such as **supply and demand, and price mechanism** were a product of classical economics\n- Understood price would result from supply and demand.\n- In this era, industrialists would produce what they thought the people wanted with no government interference.\n\n- Prior to the rise of classical economics, most economies **were under the control of some type of monarch.**\n- Under these systems, the economy was tightly controlled by the state.\n- If the King (or Queen) decides to raise your taxes, there is no one you can complain to\n- **Classical economics is the opposite of *\"command and control\"* systems and became associated with freedom.**\n- Feudal system was kinda communist??? There was no private entity.\n\n\n",

There was no private entity.\n- As feudal systems lose power, it seemed natural economics would be more free.\n- **The Invisible Hand:** metaphor for demand and supply, the **forces that move the free market**.\n\t- Individuals work in self interest, and are selfish. However, as everyone works to improve themselves, everyone becomes richer and thus society becomes richer.\n- The constant change of pressures on supply and demand create natural movement of prices and the flow of trade.\n- **Laissez-faire**, meaning let it go, in an approach to the market.\n- It believes the **market will find equilibrium**, however, this is untrue, as market always moves towards equilibrium due to there always being a present force for change.\n\t- Equilibrium can be high or low, \nMain Classical Economists:\n- Adam Smith - wealth of nations\n- David Ricardo - free trade, **comparative advantage**\n- Karl Marx - Worried about the worker being abused by the capitalists, is at the end of the classical economist, because he was in the period. However, he perceived a weakness of the classical economics school.\n### Keynesian Economics\n- A school of economic thought founded by john Maynard Keynes and developed by his followers.\n- Believed consumers should spend money.\n- He placed emphasis from the study of the economic behaviour of individuals and companies to the study of the behaviour of the economy as a whole - i.e. self interest on individual not important.\n- The main idea is that **aggregate demand (total)** is created by household, business, *and government*.\n- *Dynamics* of **free market** is NOT the main force of an economy.\n\t- The nazi's created infrastructure, and helped Germany come out of the great depression early.\n\t- This is an example of government interference.\n- Said that **free markets have no self balancing mechanism**, and **government must interfere**.\n- **Government interference should be through public policies to achieve full employment and price stability**.\n- During recession, more spending, during boom less spending.\n- *Employment stimulates aggregate demand*\n- Keynesian explores when the **macroeconomy** is in recession, or  **disequilibrium**. \n\n\"He advocates interference in the market, more or less government spending depending on circumstances\"\n\n### Supply side Economics\n- Theory that income taxes reduce incentives for *work, savings, and investment,* and that accelerated **economic growth** without **inflation** can be achieved by increasing the supply of goods and services\n\t- If taxes are cut, individuals will be incentivised to work hard, earn more money, and invest\n\t- Cut business taxes will lead to employment, investment, etc.\n\t- There will be no inflation due to investment\n- Supply side economics advocates large scale **tax cuts**, for individuals and corporation, and *deregulation of business (they can do anything they want, as it will benefit economy)* and **strong incentives for investment**.\n- This doesn't usually works, as 75% of tax cuts received by corps were not invested (donald trump tax cuts). The following happened:\n\t- Gave bonuses\n\t- Share buy schemes? They buy shares, so owners get profits\n- On individual level, tax cuts had no real impact, as they weren't paying any tax anyways.\n\t- Their spending didn't change, and their savings didn't improve\n- **Theory that says increased production drives economic growth**.\n- **Factors of production:** Capital, labour, entrepreneurship and land.\n- Focuses on businesses and firms. Create jobs, people will go and spend, people will help economic growth, and more jobs will be created. \n- Examples:\n\t- Reaganomics\n\t- Bush Tax Cuts\n\t- Trump Tax Cuts\n- Economist associated with supply side:\n\t- Robert Mundell\n\t- Arthur Laffer\n\t- Herbert Stein\n\n**Keynesian vs Supply side**\n- Keynesian is driven by **aggregate demand**. When demand increases, factories will produce stuff for demand\n- Supply side says producing things first will lead to people buying it.\n\n### Monetarism\n- Monetarism is an economic theory that regards the **money supply** as the most important **driver of economic growth**. - supply of money is the most important driver of growth???\n\t- For Classical, its about market, for Keynes, its about aggregate demand, for supply, its about aggregate supply, for monetarism, its about how much **money is in circulation**. People with more money will spend it, and create **high economic growth**.\n- If you increase the money supply abut x% per year, you will get x% economic growth.\n- As money supply grows, people demand more goods,  and factories will produce more, creating new jobs and furthering economic growth. \n- Increase money supply at *exact percentage* to prevent inflationary pressures.\n- **Central banks** play a role in monetary pressures as they *control the money supply*. \n- When the money supply increases, the cost of money increases. This leads to more borrowing, lower interest rates, they will spend, and this *increases economic growth*.\n- Interest rates are the **cost of money**.\n- More money out there, cost goes down. \nEconomists:\n- Milton Friedman\n- Alan Greenspan\n",

    "content": "# Econ Class 9\n\n## BTC (Business Trade Cycle):\n- Fluctuations in the **rate of growth**(*growth rate*) of real output.\n- Sometimes it expands, and sometimes it contrasts, the rate at which it expands or contracts is changing.\n- A contraction could be just slowing down.\n- 2 Quarters of **negative** growth rate:\n\t- This is called a *technical recession*.\n\t- Negative growth means you produced less than what you did last time.\n- An expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP, shown by those parts of the curve that slope upwards.\n- During periods of real GDP growth, employment of resources increases, and the general price level of the economy usually beings to rise more rapidly (known as inflation)\n- Peak is the highest rate of economic growth! Real GDP always grows unless its a retraction. (wtf)\n- Expansion is when the rate of economic growth is increasing.\n\n**Capacity: how much an economy can handle.**\n- How many factors of production an economy has.\n\nEconomies don't always use their full capacity. When you come out of a trough, you have **spare capacity**. Coming out a trough and beginning expansion, there will **not be any inflationary pressures**. There is *space* for expansion.\n\nAt the start, you are able to *increase output without inflation!!*\n\nWhen you get to the top of your expansion, you are starting to maximise your factors of production. The ability to produce more to meet demand becomes more difficult, this causes inflation.\n\nIn Australia, we are seeing that we are reaching the end of expansion in our business trade cycle.\n\nBecause we have low unemployment, we have a high demand for goods to be produced, however there is a labour shortage due to low employment. Therefore, there is less supply to meet demand, and we get inflationary pressures\n\n**Peak:** the maximum point of real GDP growth, marks the end of an expansion.\n- You cannot maintain a peak very long, due to capacity constraints.\n- At some point, people will be *unable to afford* an increase in prices, *reducing demand*. This leads to a **contractionary period**.\n\n**Contraction:**\n- Following the peak, the economy experiences falling real GDP (**slowing down** or negative growth).\n- If **negative growth** lasts 2 Economic Quarters, it is a recession, and caused by **falling real GDP** and **growing unemployment**.\n- **Increases in the price levels may slow down a lot**, and prices may even fall.\n- Inflationary pressures will start to *ease*.\n\n**Trough:**\n- The bottom of the business cycle, e.g. when there is a decreased economic growth (*not necessarily negative!*)\n- There may now be **widespread unemployment**.\n- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion (also known as a recovery), marking the beginning of a new cycle.\n\nIn economies there is always **a certain level of investment, and economic activity**.\n- Thus, troughs will always be temporary.\n\nThe business cycle is usually irregular, as they do not occur at regular time intervals, and are unpredictable\n\n**Good government policy** aims to *smoothen* the business cycle, and make them less volatile.\n\n- You want a **long term** of economic growth.\n\n- Upwards and downward phases of the business trade cycle are both bad in their own ways.\n- Smoothening the growth is best for the economy! \n- Flat line over a curvy line! :)\n\nImmigration gives economic growth. It leads to move people, and thus increases labour, and creates demand for more goods alongside more jobs.\n\n**Indicators Activity:**\n*Factors of Production and Labour Market*:\nFrom 2015 to 2020, there is an evident decrease in unemployment rate, while the underemployment rate remained rather stable. From 2015 to 2020, the unemployment rate went from roughly 6.1% to 5%, while the underemployment rate was almost unchanged, dropping partially from 8.8% to 8.7%. This indicates that the economy was in an expansionary phase, as labour is being sought after to fulfil capacity in the economy.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the underemployment and unemployment rate spiked drastically as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. However, the rates have recovered and dropped significantly. The unemployment rate went from 7% at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic to 3.3%. This indicates that the economy has recovered from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, and the economy is seeing a strong expansionary phase. In recent years it appears that the decrease in unemployment rate is decreasing, indicating that this expansionary phase may be coming to a close.\n\nIn terms of job vacancies and advertisements, from 2015 to 2020, vacancies were steadily increasing while advertisements remained relatively constant. Vacancies increased from 1.2% to 1.7%, while advertisements maintained a rate of 1.2%. This indicates an expansionary phase, as greater vacancies indicates a higher capacity of the market, and thus leading to higher economic growth. From 2020 to 2022, we see both job vacancies and advertisements fall as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, while as the economy recovered, vacancies and advertisements shot up drastically. Vacancies went from  an all-time low of 1%, not seen before in recent decades, to an all-time high of 3.4%. Advertisements went from 0.5% to roughly 2%. This indicates that despite the pandemic, the economy still has unutilized capacity for economic growth, which is now being used. This indicates an expansionary phase. Furthermore, this links to the lower unemployment rates, as high vacancies and advertisements generally indicates a low unemployment. However, this may indicate further inflationary pressures in the future if the demand for labour is not met.\n\nIn terms of participation rates, from 2015 to 2020, participation rates were increasing, going from 64.8% to 65.3%. This indicates that labour was being utilized more efficiently in the economy, indicating strong economic growth. This is characteristic of an expansionary phase. Furthermore, high participation rates coupled with low unemployment indicates that labour is in high demand, and that there is greater pressure on businesses for labour, potentially indicating a future increase in wage and inflationary pressures for the overall economy.\n\n*Household Sector*:\nFrom 2015 to 2020, disposable income appeared to be slowly growing from 0% to 2%, while consumption fell slightly from 2% to 1%. From 2020 to 2022, consumption dropped significantly initially to almost -12%, spiking drastically as the peak of the pandemic came to an end at 15% and finally ending at 4%, while disposable income spiked to about 8%, and then dropping to 1.5%. \n\nFor the saving ratio, between the years 2015 to 2020, the saving ratio initially decreased from 6% to 5% in 2018, however started to increase towards the end of 2020, to 7.8%. At the start of the 2020 pandemic, the saving ratio spiked drastically to 24%, however it has fallen to 12% in 2022, randomly spiking to 20% in the middle of 2021. \n\nIn terms of the total housing loan commitments, between the years 2015 and 2020, the rate was turbulent. From the years 2020 to 2022, the rate spiked at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic, and remaining at about $32 billion, an all-time high.\n\n*Australian Inflation*:\nFrom the years 2015 to 2020, inflation rose at an unstable rate, rising from 1.2% to just above 2%. However, inflation dropped to below 0%, due to the covid-19 pandemic. However, it has risen drastically between the years 2020 to 2022, going from below 0% to more than 6%.\n\n*Interest Rates*:\nFrom the years 2015 to 2020,  the cash rate remained constant at a stable 1.5%. It started to fall in near the end of 2019, and then dropped drastically to almost 0.1%, presumably due to the covid-19 pandemic. However, in the middle of 2021 it has recovered to about 1.3%.\n\n[saving rate?]\n\nIn terms of the total housing loan commitments, between the years 2015 and 2020, the rate was turbulent. From the years 2020 to 2022, the rate spiked at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic, and remaining at about $32 billion, an all-time high.\n\n*Business Sector*:\nIn the years 2015 to 2020, the GDP growth was steady, staying roughly around 3%. However, due to the pandemic, GDP growth dropped to -6%. In the years recovering from the pandemic, it rose to 9%, and has now dropped back down to 4%. \n\nThe indicators in the NAB business survey all display moderate growth before the pandemic, a steep decline, and a quick recovery.\n\n*Level of firm investment*:\nBusiness investment has only been declining. It appears unaffected by the pandemic, bar a slight increase. It dropped from 13% in 2015 to 11% in 2022.\n\nWage price index growth stayed quite consistent throughout 2015 to 2020, however it was turbulent with highs and lows.\n\nIn terms of business investment components, machinery has remained constant, however, it has been declining in recent years, dropping from 4.2% in 2015 to 4% in 2022. Engineering was coming down from a large spike in 2015, and has since been declining, dropping from 3.4% in 2015 to 2.8% in 2022. For buildings, it has remained stable but is in decline, going from 2.5% to 2.3%.\n\n*Economic Growth*:\nWay before the global pandemic, GDP growth was rather low. It stayed close to 3%, bar some small peaks. During the pandemic, GDP growth dropped to about -6%, but has since recovered to almost 45.\n\nThe indicators for capacity utilisation all display moderate growth before the pandemic, a steep decline, and a quick recovery. Company profits and levels of investment show similar trends\n\n*Government*:\nThe government budget balance has been in deficit for many years. Briefly before 2008, the government saw major surplus, however since then the government has been in deficit, however, this deficit appears to be improving towards a surplus. The size of these deficits have been decreasing in the last 5 years. This indicates that economic activity is growing.\n\n*Commodities*:\nLNG prices have spiked in recent years, going to almost 200 USD per barrel. This appears to be stabilising, and is now currently 150 USD per barrel.\nBrent oil has only been increasing however, going from 25 USD per barrel during the covid pandemic to 23 USD per barrel.\n\n",

    "content": "\n*because i love thinking about education systems*\n\n## Context\nI was out shopping with my dad talking about uni stuff then I asked \"Which units cost the most?\" He said he didn't know but it didn't matter. At this point I was completely unaware of the existence of HECS and questioned whether he would be fine covering the units, because I was assuming he would pay for it (sorry if this is a rich kid moment). He laughed and then told me about HECS, and included the fact that **there is a variable interest rate!**\n\n## Clarifications\nI fully support the existence of HECS. I love that it means students do not have to pay upfront for education. This makes education much more economically feasible assuming that post-university students will soon get stable income and thus be able to pay their loans off. What I disagree with is the variable interest rate. My idealised concept of HECS would be students get the loan, and they pay off the amount they receive annually, i.e. a loan with no interest. In 2002-03 the government made $1.18 billion in student loan repayments. This accounts for **0.672571429%** of the overall revenue made in 2002-03 (yes I pulled up old budget docs). \n\n## But why?\nI can certainly see the financial incentive behind a variable interest rate for student education, but I believe that this interest rate **disencourages students**. Disencouraged students means less people with degrees. Thus less educated people filling lower-paying jobs, and in the long term economic and scientific progress is stunted. This is bad, both for government coffers and the development of our society.\n\n## What should be done?\nRemove the god damn interest rate.\n\n![[000_Files/000a_images/Cycloaddition between a nitrone and a cyclooctyne.png]]\n*Above: Cycloaddition between a nitrone and a cyclooctyne*",

    "title": "11-04-2023 A manifesto",
    "content": "\n*literal goldstein moment*\n\nAfter a few nights of sleep, I've realised that I've probably been a little rash and brazen. I don't think the town is doomed. I still see hope in the town, and I want it to thrive. I think.\n\nBut I'm going to be honest. One might even call me Frank. There is a stigma in the town. An educated literature student such as Widjaja might describe there being a positive(thanks christian), cutthroat attitudes prevalent in the context of the town.\n\nWhy do I find this so bad? It's not because I have anything wrong with such environments. They are fine for like corporate offices and the likes. But not here. In a place that was built on the values of co-operation and equality, this environment cannot be allowed to thrive, and to sit idly by and let it prosper is a betrayal of the original cause. \n\nAbout that whole new town thing. I think I may have misconstrued what I meant by that. My bad fellas. By a new town, I don't mean I'm gonna copy paste the general structure of the current town, recruit new people, and start fresh. In line (haha latex joke) with the big new project thing I've been thinking about, the \"town\" as I was talking about is not a town in the sense that I may have implied(once again, my bad). The \"town\" I was referring to was actually intended to be made entirely by me. It would be a showcase of my works as I strive to achieve a greater goal. To achieve what the town dreamed of but never reached. Details later.\n\nWait. God dammit. Instead of writing a manifesto I made one of the md messages again. Ah. My medicine has been running low so ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nAnyways, here is the manifesto\n\n1. Direct democracy\n\t- Every member gets **one vote**. Members can submit proposals for town policy. *If a member is unavailable while a vote happens, it is assumed their vote is a no*. \n\t- You may argue \"oh what if its an emergency?\" It's the town. We are literally just an analogy. There can't possible be an emergency other than exams, to which I say I'm sure if you really need a missing person's vote just wait like a day or so\n\n2. Collaboration\n\t- Contrary to popular belief, I strongly believe in collaboration(yes I am now just realising how unenglish that sounds, bear with me(haha bear 🐻)) and open-sourced-ness on websites. But as Christian has demonstrated, we have reached a point where **once one uploads to the internet, they have lost control of their stuff**. Yes, sounds familiar right? That's what the omega chad Paul Litherland said. Now, as I'm sure everyone will agree, what Litherland is saying is not wrong. Now, we can't change how the social medias operate. But we **can change how we operate**. And so, my proposal is that collaboration can exist in the town, **in a safe and bubbly and happy and awesome and poggies environment**. People can share their work without have their work **ridiculed, and most importantly taken without consent**.\n\n3. Rights of the member\n\t- This goes hand in hand with point 2. For a safe and genial(google this) social order, I think it is fitting to give rights to each and every member. Christian may argue this and say \"huh duh rights bad\". Fine. Call them privileges. They are build on the same principle as Christian's \"privileges\", but instead they are called \"rights\". Why are they called rights? So when someone breaks the rules I can say \"all you have now are lefts\". Funny. Humour.\n\t- Hence, I propose the town member have the following rights:\n\t\t- **Right to property**: Members of the town reserve full intellectual rights to their property. This applies even after said property has been uploaded to their website, and their github repository (or other mediums(haha physics) of an online presence)\n\t\t- **Right to respect**: Members have their own right to be respected. No slander on the websites.\n\t\t- **Right to equality**: Once a member of the town, they can only lose their membership by their own volition. Hence, member proposals that work to diminish or remove another member's position in the town is not poggies and not cool.\n\t\t\t- **Exception A**: Members that break rules(slander is considered a breach of right to respect) can be kicked out by proposal. This is essentially point 4.\n\t\t- {{add more rights here}}: you can add rights! just approve of this manifesto and propose away (not propose as in marriage propose(that would be odd))\n\n4. Punishment (oh no scary)\n\t- Punishment is a scary word. Hence, I will not be proposing very harsh punishments. Other than breaking the above tenets *can* result in being removed or suspended as a member of a town. By suspended I literally mean timeout or something in the group chat. This can be appealed of course. At any time, and anyways the members of the town as a whole decide the punishment and duration.\n\n5. Who shall enforce this?\n\t- No one. I'm writing this proposal not to make some centralised dictatorship over the town (trust me guys the whole mayo title thing was a joke). I just wanted to set in writing some ideals for the town that I felt were it's original values, and hope that they will be adhered to.\n\nBefore I end, I would like to say that I have no intention of shoving this agenda down people's throat. Of course, elections exist for a reason, and this manifesto will serve as my campaign points. You have every right to disagree with them, or agree with them and vote for another candidate (christian obviously) for other reasons.\n\nI'm not doing this out of spite. I'm not doing this out of pity. I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing it for the town. The way I see it, sooner or later the contrast between the present town and the past will widen, and as a result, the town will fall apart, just like most of the other projects(See [FTH](31-03-2023%20The%20Fred%20Tendency%20Hypothesis%20(FTH).md)). I don't want that. I want the town to prosper ~~so I can integrate it into my greater project~~. \n\nIf you are considering voting for me, **please read this fully**! The one thing I hate more than centrists are people who support politicians that actively work against their own interests. You all have a right to pursue your own goals, and so transparency is a focal point of my campaign.\n\n\n*With love(but now for dasindu cause i kinda need his vote(this is a joke i would like to re-iterate: no plans for rigged eleections))*\n\n\n*Ed*\n\n*hope it gets implemented*\n",

    "content": "\n*a dialogue between me and jonathan about intelligence*\n\n**ed**: we are geniuses man\nwhat are your thughts on that\n\n**jonathan**: i do believe\nthat that is quite\na brilliant thesis\n\n**ed:** i too also believe\n\n**jonathan:** please\nprovide evidence\n\n**ed**: i absolutely concur\nevidence? my good sir\ni would have to suppose for the sake of a contrapositive that if we are not idiots, then we are not smart. we know that we are not idiots. hence if we assume the converse of the statement has a positive truth statement it follows that without a loss of generaility that we are not idiots, so we must thus be smart as required qed\n\n**jonathan**: you raise quite a brilliant point, my good fellow. however, converses are not always true, hence one could argue that your proof is false\n\n**ed**: ah, i completely understand your point, my good friend, however i believe that if you consider the implications of our statement with the riemann hypothesis, you will come to the shcoking conclusion that by analysing the rate of which the forward and reverse reactions in the equilibrium are affected by a change in the state of subdivision of the reactant, one realises that regardless of whether the riemann hypothesis is true then the statement is true. Hence as the riemann hypothesis can either be true or not true, it follows the statement is always true as required. furthermore if you consider that the litmus molecule is blue after having ionised a single hydrogen, one realises that the combustion of said organic molecule results in a redox reaction between the organic substance and oxygen, which is contrary to the expected halogen displacement reaction, hence one takes the partial derivative and can thus prove that we are intelligent\n\n**jonathan**: ah, i see your argument, and raise a counterpoint. i believe that if you take into account the tragedy of the commons and its activation state, by analysing the enthalpy created by the infinite path of a unit vector, you can thus conclude that despite the enthalpy created, one's statement can be inherently false. furthermore, if you look at the unit vector created by the air resistance of the sound waves, one may see that the unit vector gradually dissipates over time due to energy absorbance, which is contrary to our statement that the unit vector's path is infinite, thus one takes the combination and permutation of all factors and can thus conclude that there is a slight chance that we are not, in fact, intelligent, and perhaps actually idiots\n\n**ed**: that is potentially a case, however i feel that you are missing the point, and may be missing a few cases. for example, consider the case that we are averaging over ~~95~~92 in methods, which is true. hence it follows as people who average ~~95~~92 are smart people , we are thus smart as required. i understand your reasoning for using the classic unit vector proof, however i do believe that if you consider the arctan of the segment and extrapolates this value into the complex plane, projecting this data through the triangle inequality ends up suggesting that we are infact human beings, which is a key determinant in us being smart. if we take this a step further and take the nested root of i, using feynmann parametization, can conclude that there is a 7C5/8C5 probability that we are intelligence, it follows that if we are humans, and there is a 7C5/8C5 probability that we are intelligence, one can conclude that there is a high likelihood that we are intelligence people. i do hope you get better at exploring your proofs, perhaps consider adding a galvanic cell into your brain and then increase the hydroxide concentration to favour the reactive process of the lead-acid battery accumulator.\n\n**jonathan**: your point is quite valid, however i have noticed a fatal flaw. the kinetic energy combined with the potential energy and normal force creates an overflow of dispersion forces, meaning that the electrons will move more rapidly. furthermore, hydrogen bonding will also occur at the equilibrium point, meaning that the Sartre hypothesis will prove correct, that our lives are meaningless without purpose, and from this we can conclude, that, by choosing 8 objects from 6, we can further support our point. another point of interest will occur when you consider the inelastic collision created by the collision of our 2 arguments. by analysing your findings, you will discover that the energy created after the collision is greater than the energy in the system before. this means that the process is energetically favourable and thus is soluble in the liquid of human thought. thus, by passing this through the darwinism theory, we can thus conclude that some part of your argument may be partly false.\n\n**ed**: i see what you mean, however as the legendary erik satie once said, \"De manière à obtenir un creux\", i.e. \"so as to be a hole\". I feel that you have fallen into the classic trap, the hole if you will, of considering the average kinetic energy of ideal gas particles, and applying this to elastic collisions, which would be correct if we were to assume that we live in a 3-dimensional universe, however as we made the question we cannot simply assume such a bold claim. your thesis has to account for more than just a 3-dimensional reality, and thus i propose we use string theory to consider the many possible dimensions possible. furthermore, your logic falls apart when you consider elastic collisions, as we know from the author of the book \"physics\", dr waters has said that elastic collisions only occur for ideal gas particles, and as humans while we may consist of some gasses, we simply cannot state that humans themselves are gas particles, as we are actually made of multiple substances, that transfer electrons through the process known as redox, i.e. reduction and oxidation, and this process yield thats we must derive a compromise function for the manufacturing of ammonia in the equilibrium system n2 + 3h2 \u003c--\u003e 2nh3. we know this reaction is exothermic, hence we must find a point where x = e^ln(5), it follows that the compromise is a moderate temperature and a high pressure, which further implies that not only are we moving close to the speed of sound, we do so by emitting intelligence rays, hence we are a point source of intelligence, so we are thus intelligent beings.\n\n**jonathan**: your point most definitely is well defined. however, as the great strategist Sun Tzu once said, \"Suǒyǒu de zhànzhēng dōu jiànlì zài qīpiàn zhī shàng\", or \"all war is based on deceit\". you see, i had left out a crucial fact in my argument, a slight amount of deceit, if you will, which would be, that if you consider the theory of relativity, and the homogenous mixture created from this, and show that the spherical wavelets created from this are actually not tangent to the new wavefront, and instead propagate parallel to the wavefront, and in fact touch at all angles. one can thus reason from this that the highest point of the parabola will intersect where the activation energy required with a catalyst is equal to the square root of the added mass of the reactants, and from this we can gain a net value for x, and thus determine the domain. futhermore, if you consider the ramifications of the animalia kingdom, you will find that in the translation, when the messenger RNA is sent, another particle is actually ejected, known as confusin, or the \"stupid\" protein. this potentially activates inside ones brain, and renders one argument as incoherent, thus your argument could potentially be incorrect. i would like to conclude with a statement, that we are now chilling, bing chlling if you will.",

    "title": "16-04-2023 A (hopefully) complete guide on learning chemistry well",
    "content": "\n*written by someone who knows how to study chem in theory but not in practice*\n\nHello!\n\nIf you are reading this you are probably Thomas. If not, damn. What can I say. You outsmarted me there. \n\nAnyways, before I give some actual tips, I'm gonna take this opportunity to discuss something I feel that is crucial if you want to do well in any subject, let alone chemistry.\n\nAnd that thing is called **passion**.\n\n## Background research\n\nFor those who are currently chemistry students (yr 11-12, but if you're in yr 12 and you're doubting your passions in chemistry i think you have some pressing issues), you will be slammed with a bunch of content. Acid bases, organic, bonding, IMF, redox, etc. When you are taught these things, you can respond in one of two ways:\n\n1. Damn! This is so cool! And interesting! I find this really facinating!\n2. What the hell. This is so boring. I can't wait for the next topic.\n\nBefore I make any definitive claims, I also want you to consider the type of student that you classify yourself as. Are you an \"academic student\"? Do you aspire to have a high ATAR, be a doctor, etc.? Or are you fine with a *subpar* ATAR? What I'm trying to say is, is chemistry vital to your ATAR goals (e.g. you wanna be a doctor so you take chem cause its requirement)?\n\nHence, the way I see it there are 4 types of students based from these broad derivations:\n1. **Love chem, academic:** Then this guide is perfect for you! Not only will I (attempt to) teach you how to excel in chem, but also how to do so in a way that keeps your passion. And I have experience in this. In yr 10 (accel), I hated chem. I felt that my passion for chemistry should reflect in my marks, but it didn't. And that was a downer. I was sadge. But having experienced it I understand why now.\n2. **Hate chem, academic:** Hmm. You may find this guide useful. There's nothing wrong with hating chem. It's just unfortunate that you have to do it. The way I see it, studying a subject you have no passion for makes it much more harder. \n3. **Love chem, not academic:** I think its cool beans and amazing that you love chem as much, maybe even more than I do. This guide will be somewhat helpful. I can give suggestions as to where you can go looking to feed your curiosity. But it's up to you to like actually do study, rather than purely explore the topics. (it becomes even funner if you become academic/competitive in chem, trust)\n4. **Don't love chem, not academic:** If you scroll up to the top of this page, you'll find a 3 bar button. Press it, and you'll get the sidebar, which showcases my most recent writings. Pick any that suit you.\n\n## Material list\n- haha i've had the brilliant idea to structure this like a science report how goofy and wacky and quirky\n\n### Textbooks\n- (see [Chemistry Resources review](Chemistry%20Resources%20review.md) for a more in-depth look into textbooks for chem.)\n- Here are some books I fully endorse:\n\t- **Lucarelli (Essential Chem):** Beautiful. Especially the sets. They are long and tedious. But they are great for refining your understanding. (if you think 3 pages of questions is painful, wait till you get to yr 12💀)\n\t- **Wace Study Guide:** Revision is a little scuffed, but if you've managed your time you shouldn't need it. Maybe briefly read over it before a test, might be helpful to cross-check your knowledge.\n- Here are the book(s) that I'm a little sus about:\n\t- **STAWA:** These people are crooks. Not a single STAWA book that I've owned has had a stable, working binder. The book just falls apart. Rubbish. Made in China. However, the calculation questions are good. And the sets are alright. They can get pretty long at times, even longer than some Lucarelli sets. Your in-class chem experiments come from this book.\n- Here are the book(s) that I despise:\n\t- **Pearson:** Absolute filth that has desecrated the paper its written on. Rubbish. Absolute rubbish! The chapters are long, tedious, and dismally boring enough to make someone comatose. And the questions are completely stupid. Like, \"Why does Australia store more water per person than any other country?\" What a god damn goofy and stupid question. All part of a wider conspiracy to suck chem students' wallets dry.\n\n### General resources\n- *Computer* - pretty self explanatory, you need something to take notes in class with. I don't suggest using a notebook, although its probably better and people will call you a sigma male/female.\n- *An (almost) endless supply of textbooks to write in* - Chem sets take **space**. As of so far, I have gone through 3.5 books of chem textbooks, which are filled with STAWA  or Lucarelli sets, Wace Study Guide, etc.\n- *Use [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)* - Out of all the studying resources, I recommend this one. It's for the people who care about treeeeeeeeeeees, but also want to study. You can essentially do your pomodoro timer here, but my general advice for how long you should study chemistry, for people who care about chemistry is this: **Find the motivation to study chemistry. Then study for as long as you can, and/or until you get bored. Then take a break, rinse and repeat**.\n\t- This is probably **my most crucial point**. I feel that chemistry, while is bad to cram under time pressure, can be learnt really quickly if you put in the time (i haven't put in the time). So, study for as long as you find the motivation to.\n- *The obvious things* - pen, pencil, ruler, rubber, etc.\n\n## Methodology\nSo, let's say that you've just started chemistry. You've just begun the course. What to do now?\n\nDon't worry. It's not like it was essential to study on the holidays (though highly recommended but not by Ms Holland for some curious reason). But it's time to put in the work.\n\n1. You **must** do some amount of work **every week**. If not, you **will** fall behind. Chem is one of those subjects where there is a lot of practice available for you, and where it's expected that you do all those practice, just as a standard. I'm not even talking about doing practice papers/tests, etc. Here is my suggestion: **do *at least* one Lucarelli and one STAWA set each week. When you finish a topic, do the chapter review of Wace Study guide.**\n2. Listen in class, and **take notes!** At the end of the day, its the **teachers that mark your tests**, not the internet or your friends. The things they say reflect **their own interpretation of chemistry** (sometimes chem is subjective like that), so you should pay attention and write down critical points. \n3. Do **not** be afraid of asking questions! Questions are essential to having a complete understanding of chemistry. No one expects you to understand everything just by learning it from a textbook or your teachers(unless your name is pranav borude). If you're paying attention in class, and exercising something I like to call *critical thinking*, you'll probably have a few questions. Ask your teacher. Not only do you get a more accurate understanding of chemistry, but also you get further insight into your teacher's **interpretation**.\n\nLet's say you've done all of that. You've got a test coming up soon. Now what?\n\n4. Past papers. Here's a controversial opinion. Past papers are the **best** way to get better grades in chemistry. Putting in the time and actually doing your papers properly (time pressure, mark them after, being strict on yourself) will give you an inexplicable advantage.\n5. Wace study guide trial tests. They are good. Do them. Don't forget to do them.\n\nAnd that's it! That's essentially how to become good at chem. I may be missing something. Please message me and I will add it here. :)\n\nGood luck! And most importantly, **enjoy chem!**\n\n\n*With love,*\n\n*Ed*\n",

    "title": "18-02-2023 The Legend of 0 point 38mm",
    "content": "\n*please man i just want a smooth pen for chem*\n\n## Preface\n\nThis is where I shall document my spiritual journey and awakening with the pens I used.\n\n## Sharpie S Gel 0.7mm\nThis was where it all began. Upon using this pen for the first time, my mind was blown. All my life, I thought pens were meant to be pressed firmly into the paper. But writing with this pen was truly a turning point in my life. The ink flowed like water, and my writing speed doubled. The only downside was, it was too large. While my writing speed doubled, my handwriting (which was already atrocious) halved in quality. From an outside perspective, one could see that my low average in chem was directly proportional to the quality of my handwriting (lets ignore that it was primarily cause i was lazy). This sparked a search for a finer pen size, i.e. 0.5 or 0.38mm, but alas, Sharpie is American, and such finer pen tips were only found in the land of freedom. Furthermore, the 0.7mm was **incredibly blotchy**. Like seriously, I'd write a single line and my right hand would become blackened instantly. This was a major let-down for me, and I couldn't handle having my writing become unreadable if I accidentally slid my finger across the letters.\n\n## Muji Smooth Gel Ink Pen 0.38mm\nThis was an *interesting* pen. While my handwriting certainly got better, this pen lacked the free-flowing ability of the Sharpie pens. In fact, one could say that the pen was rather scratchy, as it felt so resistant and produced such a thin line. Overall, this pen does hold a soft spot in my heart as it got me through sem 2 of yr 10. \n\n## Muji Smooth Gel Ink Pen 0.5mm\nNow this was a significant upgrade. This pen allowed my handwriting to be \"reasonably\" good (my mother would say otherwise), and like all Muji ink pens, was relatively smooth. This pen felt like perfect, but I was longing for something more. I missed the free-flowing of the Sharpie pen, but also wanted it to have a relatively medium (0.50mm) pen tip.\n\n## Pentel Energel 0.4mm ball Needle Point + Pop Urban 0.7mm ball pen\nYou may ask \"What the hell is Pop Urban\"? Well, first, popular. No, not the adjective, the store in many Asian countries! Popular  supplies a brand, \"Pop Urban\". I'm now just realising that they probably own this pen brand. Anyways, despite being 0.7mm, the ink produced was vivid and sharp, and was almost as smooth as the Sharpie pen. Hence, I used it in conjunction with the Pentel pen. Now this pen was quite like the Muji 0.38 one. Incredibly sharp, but very smooth as well. Problem is, the Pop Urban pens only come from Popular, and the Pentel pen is like $6 per pen, which is absolutely ridiculous. So, the journey continues for the perfect pen. And I think I'm on to something. Here's to the future.\n\n## Pentel Energel 0.7mm ball Needle Point\nButtery smooth. But too big. If there existed a 0.5mm version, I would be ecstatic.\n\nTHERE EXISTS A 0.5 VERSION. I WILL BE BUYING IT SOON.\n\n## Pentel Energel 0.5mm ball Needle Point\n\nI've done it fellas. This is the pen. The pen I've been dreaming of. The one I have been lusting for. My greater half, the complement to P(Me), the Jekyll to my Hyde, the Christian to myself, the equal amount of acid to the equal amount of base resulting in equivalence, the chem past papers to my chem grades, the pranav and the me (funny men), and so on.\n\nI love this pen. They are expensive. But they are beautiful. They write so smoothly its a feeling I can't describe. I think 0.5mm is the right size for me, but my writing is getting a little bulky so I might switch back to the 0.4mm. But this is just top tier. None of the resistance the sharpie s-gel pens had. This is (very close to) perfection.\n\nNow the next step is to make my own pen company and design a brand of pens specifically tailored to me.\n\n",

    "title": "18-03-2023 Dutch Democracy",
    "content": "\n*dutch democracy amirite!*\n\n## Context/Ranting\n\nDutch democracy is cracked, and I feel that people overlook this.\n\nImagine Australia elects a government, and then they do something sus and make a specific voting group angry. Unfortunately for that voting group, Australia is a two-party state, hence to not support the government(suppose it is the Labour party) would be to support the opposition(Liberals), and thus support all these other opposition policies that they don't necessarily agree with.\n\n**This isn't how it works in the Netherlands!!**\n\nThe big guy, Mark Rutte, did something sus. He make farmers go angy. Some guy was like \"ah climate change ammonia emissions reduction can't be met\" and Rutte was like \"oh then lets tell the Haber processing till they've Haber processed their way into extinction\" and place restrictions on farmer things.\n\nFarmer don't like when government do bad thing to them.\n\nWhat would they do in Australia? Support the Nationals. And the farmers who didn't believe in the whole \"social conservatism\" stuff would just have to suck it.\n\nWhat would they do in the Netherlands. Form a [new political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer%E2%80%93Citizen_Movement). And the fact that they can just do that is bloody amazing and I don't think people realise how amazing that is.\n\n## Why is it cool to form a new party?\n\nTaking a look at the Dutch parliament, one will realise that *there are quite a few parties*.\n\nCompared to Australia, which has like only 4 main parties, and is heavily skewed to the Labour and Liberal parties, the Dutch have [so many damn parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_Netherlands). And they all get moderate amounts of representation!\n\nSuppose the current Australian government did something bad. I dunno, maybe they said that nurses were going to prevent Australia from reaching the nurse emissions limit, hence nurses were restricted. There wouldn't be a nurse party, because nurses know damn well that such a party will never have enough power to change anything.\n\nIn this case, the Dutch government made the *farmers* angry, and they formed their own party and voted freely, knowing that their party has a chance to win. What did that result in? [This](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/rural-populist-party-farmer-citizen-movement-big-winner-dutch-elections).\n\n## Why does this matter?\n\nThe Dutch government is structured in a way that the Dutch people have **much more sway** over the government. With regional elections being commonplace, the Dutch people have the power to cripple the Dutch government, and let Mark Rutte know that they don't like what he's gonna doing.\n\nWe simply don't have that option here\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's fix our democracy. Have it so that minor parties are a viable choice, so that people that deeply care about a particular issue can support a party that **fundamentally focuses on that issue**.\n\nWe already have a cracked voting *system*. Now we need to change the voting *environment*.\n\nYea im gonna go back to reading 1984 now\n\nbye\n",

    "content": "\n*this is quite long. big philo*\n\n## Death to Copyright\n\nI don't like copyright.\n\nI guess I'm fine with the whole commercial copyright, people gotta be incentivised to make stuff. And copyright ensures that their invention will keep their coffers full till they drop dead.\n\nBut I am wholly against the copyright of educational resources. \n\nHistory has shown that societal progress and all the benefits of such progress (higher standard of living, greater opportunity, in particular *cool science things*) is driven by innovation. But to be innovative requires a strong understanding of the field you are trying to innovate in. In a rather massive, impersonal society such as ours, The only way to provide such understanding to a young population is via education. \n\nThus, my position is that education is the most crucial resource to a society, as it pulls us forwards into the future.\n\nBut educational copyright, as I like to call it, puts restraints on the accessibility of education. Quite obviously, when we put a paywall on higher education, we disadvantage those who cannot afford it.\n\nHence, the goal of this website is to make my knowledge free and accessible. I can't write a book and then make it free, that would be rather expensive. So I guess this is the next best option.\n\n## Become big brain\n\nI don't like being stupid.\n\nThis website is made using Obsidian. I have an Obsidian vault with Obsidian Git that pulls the funny md pages to github, which then converts it into a website format via Hugo, the last part is thanks to Quartz :)\n\nAnyways, I use Obsidian cause Christian Choe told me it will make me big brain.\n\nI've used it for almost a year, but I don't feel that my brain has become bigger. Nevertheless, I have faith. \n\nI have a dream.\n\nThat I'll finally create a simplistic and user-friendly labelling system for my notes.\n\nFrom there, my brain will truly become massive.\n\n## Co-existence\n\nI don't like other people.\n\nHaha just kidding. I find other people bearable. \n\nA certain \"M.Spicata\" has been yapping on about a [betternet](https://spicata.github.io/betternet/). Personally, I don't give a solid damn about the internet, or other people. But I think this whole community analogy is quite cute, if not redundant and overtly romanticised. \n\nYou may notice I have previously written on [how to setup a website via obsidian and github](25-02-2023%20How%20to%20make%20a%20note-taking%20website%20WITHOUT%20PAYING.md). This is because I believe in helping others achieve their goals. I want to see more people make personal websites where they share things (notes, blogs, etc. (maybe not blogs, they are cringe(wait i write blogs, does that mean i am cringe???))). I think a collective pooling of resources scattered on the internet is pretty poggers.\n\n## Online Bartering\n\nI don't like people who take and never give.\n\nThese people are kinda greedy(shocker). From an ethical perspective, it's purely egotistical to take the hard work of others and never return the favour. Such a mindset is driven by a desire to succeed, AND trample over others, which is a little unhealthy.\n\nHowever, my notes are on the internet, so I can't really stop you from taking.\n\nBut I can request.\n\nPlease don't come here for free notes. Help me make this website even better by contributing notes.\n\nBe like Ariz. (cool, jacked, based, etc.)\n\n\n*With love(and hatred towards dasindu),*\n\n*Ed*",

    "title": "21-05-2023 Competency in a democracy",
    "content": "\n## Preface\n\nThe town is a democracy. Hooray!! \n\nBut how come I don't feel any more democratic than before?\n\nThere is an issue. And I partly take blame for this issue. I didn't word the constitution as well as I should've, and that has led to some confusion. However I would be lying to myself if I took all the \"credit\". Because the real issue here is competency.\n\n## What is right vs... what is right???\n\nIt is right to want a democracy. That is fair. But we have to ask ourselves, is it practical? Is it morally just to appoint someone into positions of power when they have no clue what they are doing? Sure, they are popular enough not to get kicked out immediately. But they lack the understanding of how to lead and so their placement into power is simply untenable. \n\nThis is more prescient for the town. While we don't claim to be like a big, elitist, techie group, we kinda are. Hopefully not the elitist bit, but to create a website to the \"standard\" (I guess notions and wixes are allowed now, but this is in reference to Jekyll, Quartz, etc. sites) that we pride ourselves on, the leader needs to **actually be competent in these things**.\n\nConsider to back when we had Christian. Sure, I hated him because he was a dictator. But there's no denying that he knew his stuff. He knew how to make Jekyll websites, and the likes. \n\nHe was a competent leader. And the town needs competent leaders.\n\n## A thought experiment\n\nImagine this. Its like 8pm. You've come home from doing whatever (you(I) dont remember). You've been fighting against dictatorship for a few weeks, and you return to see that its completely fallen apart. Power has fractured, and someone else holds the crown. What do you do? Do you push for more? Do you threaten the stability of the town for an almost eternal crusade for democracy? \n\nOr do you let it go? Do you give the un-elected individual a chance to thrive? A chance to prove themselves capable, and unite the people.\n\nWould you turn a blind eye?\n\n## Eyes 👀\n\nI turned a blind eye when they were swiftly pushed into power.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they waited for every single person to vote yes before a town constitution was ratified.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they claimed ownership of the organisation, even thought it was not at all mentioned in the constitution.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they started making decisions without putting a vote to it.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they declared someone a member of the town, **after the bill that requires a process for such an appointment passed**.\n\nI turned a blind eye when, after being informed of that situation, ignored the constitution and declared the person in question a member of the town anyways.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they dismissed the legitimacy of a vote.\n\nI turned a blind eye when they coerced others into challenging votes simply because they were afraid of losing control.\n\nI'm not going to turn a blind eye anymore. I hope you do the same as well.\n\n## Another motive: g\\*nsh\\*in\n\nThe town is not racist. There is nothing (actually i jest there is a lot) wrong with Genshin. But it is not the game I am morally opposed to, but the degeneracy that precedes it. Genshin is an addiction, and the people that worship it have no place in our town. Hence, this declaration will have a secondary vote; to ratify and enforce a **strict genshin ban**. People who are found having genshin-related stuff on their website will be asked once - remove it or we will remove you. Failure to comply will mean a vote will be held to remove that individual, and this vote will require a 50% majority instead of the usual 70%.\n\n## The vote\n\nThis declaration can be considered a snap election vote with the intention of removing Shan-Mei as the \"mayo\" of the town and replacing her with Ed(thats me guys how crazyyyy).\n\nIf this declaration is ratified by the required \u003e50% yes votes needed, it goes into effect immediately. \n\nThe voting period is 3 days.",

    "content": "\nHello!\n\nPerhaps you are reading this because you think my website looks cool and you want something like it.\n\nFirst of all, I am a Linux user that converted from Windows (sadly) so a bunch of the things I had to do (esp. trying to get around school wifi not liking ssh) will probably not apply to you.\n\nI should give an outline of what the final set-up will be:\n- Obsidian vault where you can write your notes\n- A github pages website sponsored by JZhao\n\nAll credits go to [Jacky Zhao](https://twitter.com/_jzhao?lang=en), he made literally all the code. All I am is a middleman between you and him, here to offer my guidance. (I have suffered)\n\n\n\u003e [!CAUTION] IMPORTANT!\n\u003e\n\u003e If you encounter any bugs, **please email them to me** so I can look into them.\n\n\u003e [!CAUTION] DONT BE LIKE TAJ!\n\u003e\n\u003e Don't store the file in a onedrive.\n\n## Acquire an obsidian vault\nThis *should* be self explanatory, I am going to assume you will use obsidian first and then use the website, hence I will outline how to import your data to fit with the website code.\n\n1. Go to the [obsidian download](https://obsidian.md/download), and download it.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/obby%20download%20page.png)\n\n2. Open obsidian. There will probably not be a \"content\" vault set up already, as it is not there by default.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/obby%20opened.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have downloaded obsidian. You may consider just getting into it before you make the website, but if you do so you will have to place its content inside the \"content\" folder, **including the .obsidian folder**, and then use obsidian's \"open another vault\" and open the **content folder** within the repo. This will make sense later. However, I suggest making the website first.\n\n## Create the website repository\nFirst of all, you need a github account, as we will be using github pages.\n\n1. Go to [github](https://github.com/) and make a new account.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/github%20signup%20page-1.png)\n\n2. Once you have made your account, go to [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). While **logged in**, create a new repo using the template.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/create%20new%20repo.png)\n\n3. Name the repo whatever you like. It probably doesn't matter. Ensure you **include all branches**, AND you **keep it public!!!** Github Pages will **only** work for repos that are public.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/create%20screen%20repo%20obby.png)\n\nCongrats! On your account, the repository with the name you gave it should be there. Now we need to download it onto your computer. I will assume you are using **windows.** However, as a result I will not be able to assist you. I can vaguely tell you what to do, however. Feel free to email me any questions\n\n## Downloading the repository\n\n1. Download Github desktop\n2. Add your account\n3. Open the repository online\n4. Press the green code section\n5. Open with Github Desktop\n6. Clone, and specify whatever location you want\n\nYou now have quartz on your windows computer!!! :)\n\n## Setting Up Obby inside the repository\n\n1. Open the file explorer to where the repository you just downloaded is. The folder should look something like this.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/inital%20folder%20quartz.png)\n\n2. Go back to your obsidian, (open a new vault if required), and **open folder as vault**. Select the **content** folder of the repository.\n\n3. Add your notes here! This vault is now directly connected to your online repository. Not only does that mean it is safe in the chance that you lose your data (corrupt disc or something), but you can update your website via obsidian.\n\n3a. There are many ways to update website via obsidian. However, I suggest using obsidian git(a plugin).\n\n## Configuring the repository\nFirst of all, we need to setup quartz so the pages will work. I suggest reading [JZhao's Guide](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/) on setting up these things. I'll essentially paraphrase and add things that may be needed.\n\n1. Go to the actions tab. Activate workflows.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/actions.png)\n\n2. Go to the settings tab, then go to the **pages** tab.\n- Make sure the branch is **master** and going to root. If you have  a custom domain set it up here, but its not necessary.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/pages%20quartz.png)\n\n## Configuring the clone\nOk, but to personalise your website we need to modify some things directly in the repository folder. \n\n1. Open the folder as before. It should look as it did before.\n![](000_Files/000a_images/inital%20folder%20quartz.png)\n\nI will now list the things that should be changed.\n- config.toml: (if you are using custom domain)\n```\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\nOR if you are using github pages:\n```\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/\u003cREPO-NAME\u003e/\"\n```\n\n- /.github/workflows/deploy.yaml: (if you are using custom domain)\n```\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\nOR if you are using github pages:\n```\ncname: \u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io\n```\n\n## Making it yours\n\nAlright! Upon your first push, the website will come to life. However, you might notice that it looks very much like the default site. So it's time to customise it, to your liking!\n\nOnce again, here's a list of the things that can be changed:\n- data/config.yaml:\n```\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

If you find anything confusing or you want to add any tips, please feel free to email me.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Headings in the tables of content are scuffed\n\n![](000_Files/000a_images/thomas%20bug%20headers.png)\n\nThis is an easy (if not cumbersome) fix. This means, in obsidian you are using the top level heading(i.e. one hashtag).\n\nThis, for some reason, screws with quartz. Probably cause the heading is converted to h1, which is weird cause the website expects there to only be 1 h1. Who knows.\n\nYou have to change the hierarchy, so that h2 is the highest heading you write in the .md file (two hashtags).\n\n### Actions returning exit code 128\n![](000_Files/000a_images/debug.png)\n\nThis means your computer doesn't have the right access tokens. ~~I suspect this only affects Linux computers.~~ I have been informed it affects windows as well. I'm guessing github must've changed something recently.\n\nSOLUTION:\n1. Open the settings tab\n2. Open the actions tabs, then the general tab.\n3. Under the \"Workflow permissions\" header, select the **read and write permissions** option. This ensures the GITHUB_TOKEN in the deploy action can push to the website. \n4. Save.\n",

Through marketing campaigns, increase circulation of knowledge about the town, and thus entice potential immigrants\n3.

    "title": "27-11-2022 Sleep is not as important",
    "content": "\n*In response to \"M.Spicata\"'s message to me and Fred*\n\n## 1. People are different\n- I have found that I generally don't need that much sleep to function well. It is most likely as a result of growing up, but I've ever been \"tired\" for school during Year 7. I still remember Dr Waters calling me out for yawning during his lesson. \n- This is most likely the same for Fred, however I can't exactly speak on his behalf.\n- I feel that days where I've had 6 hours of sleep turn out the same as days with 9 hours of sleep\n## 2. People adapt to their situations\n- It's just been exam week \"M.Spicata\", and I have been cramming. Cramming a lot. Perhaps if I crammed even more, I would've gotten that last stupid comp sci question. Like who tf remembers what interfaces are in Cisco, and what commands you need to set up fg0/0 and fg0/1. Anyways I digress. I have had to adapt to the situation by reducing my sleep.\n\t- **Editor's Note: Post-writing, I have the results of the Comp Sci test, and for that question (35c), I somehow got full marks. I have no clue how, my leading theory is that while marking my exam Mr Wilson suffered a series of mini-strokes that resulted in temporary disorientation and confusion, and subsequently he ignored the marking key and just gave me full marks for no reason.**\n\t- ![[000_Files/000a_images/q35a comp sci wilson moment.png]]\n\t- Regardless, I personally feel that my performance is not affected. For example, before the Literature exam I had 6 hours of sleep because I accidentally drank coffee. Despite that, I think I did rather well during the exam, however I will update this page when I have received my marks.\n\t\t- **Editor's Note: My grade increased after the Lit exam????? This is unheard of**\n- Fred also must've adapted to his situation, as we both had the same exam period, much like you. \n- In conclusion, because of exam period, we had to decrease sleep. This does not warrant the creation of a page to blatantly call us out.\n\n## 3. \"Stop playing Minecraft!!!\"\n- I have.\n\n## 4. The \"deep sleep\" argument\n- I have a somewhat reliable sleep tracker on my watch. Since I usually average 6 hours of sleep, I tend to check my watch everyday to see how much deep sleep I get. What I find is that it varies from 20m to 1h. \n\t- My conclusion from this is that deep sleep has minimal impact of the outcome of the day. These variations have occurred broadly across the past few weeks, and do not seem to have any impact on me other than psychological (placebo effect, feel better with more deep sleep).\n\n## 5. Mood\n- To quote the big green guy: \"I'm always angry\".\n\t- This is true in some sense. I tend to study as a means of fulfilling some artificial criterion in assessments. While we both have different philosophies on what study should be directed for, I personally believe that the current system of studying for exams is justifiable in some sense. It develops adaptability in students, which is a desirable characteristic of an individual in the workplace.\n\t- Anyways, what this means is that I am not motivated to study by passion (in general, with exceptions). Instead, I do so because I have commitments and goals I set out for myself, and I want to accomplish this. \n\t- As a result, \"mood\" does not play a factor in this.\n- I believe the aforementioned situation is similar for Fred, but once again I cannot speak on his behalf.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n- I'll get better sleep.\n- My lack of sleep in recent days does not warrant me and Fred being called out.\n- You stayed up to 11pm last night. \n\nThis was an experiment into writing blog-like posts, similar to \"M.Spicata\". 💖",

    "title": "28-02-2023 A response to spicatas claims on tutors",
    "content": "\n*yea this is all i do now, respond to spicata*\n\n## A vague statement\nWithout loss of generality, I feel it is safe to assume that tutors (especially uni tutors) tutor for 2 reasons:\n- Money\n- Enjoyment\n\nHence I will discuss both.\n\n## Money\nTutors that are selective give an impression of quality. This is just a fact. From a parent's mindset, if they see a tutor that can and will actively deny their business, supply and demand kicks in, hence their theoretical value increases. This is good for tutors, cause then they can charge much more. For example, lets say there are 4 children, 2 of which are \"good\". A tutor could charge x`20 per children.\nThey can also choose to refuse the 2 \"not good\" children and charge 45 per \"good\" child, and claim the increased price is because they teach \"selectively\". Quite obviously, the tutor makes more money. You could argue 20 =\u003e 45 is egregious however more than 50% of people can be chosen \"selectively\" and most tutors can theoretically have the same amount of \"not good\" students and \"good\" students. I think I've probably conveyed the point though.\n\nTLDR It is profitable to be selective with students. People can be motivated by profits, that completely fine. Unless of course, you are proposing a complete overhaul of the free market in favour of socialist education, to which I say touch grass.\n\n## Enjoyment\nTutors(like me(i only tutor fred)) actually enjoy tutoring sometimes. I understand you don't understand as you have probably not tutored anyone except your sister, however from my experience it is easier to teach people who are \"capable\", \"intelligent\", \"passionate\", etc. I'd like to add I'm  using quotation marks because I don't really believe these adjectives have much meaning. In my mind, anyone can achieve the success that they want if they put in the effort and are supported by strong foundations(resources, teachers, etc.).\n\nAnyways, just imagine spending hours repeating the same topic to students who honestly don't give a damn about a subject. To tutors, who generally tutor in the subjects which they really care about, this lack of interest is kinda disrespectful. It's not cool that the tutor has to spend time and effort and have all this learning be lost on the student.\n\n\"Good\" students are different. They (probably(fred)) care about the subjects they get tutored in. They can advance themselves with the support of their tutors, and tutors can thus derive the satisfaction of helping their students thrive. \n\nTLDR It is more enjoyable to tutor selective students.\n\n## Summary\nWe live in a democracy.\n\nLet tutors do whatever.\n",

We do not have a large enough population to require representatives.\n\nHence, this document proposes that when there is conflict in the town's decision making process, there shall be a vote to decide how we proceed. This vote shall be proposed by any town individual, and another must second it in order to initiate a vote. Ample voting time (1-2 days) must be given, and a vote only starts when it is announced. In that announcement the correct period of which the vote is held must be detailed.\n\nTown members must be duly informed that a vote is occuring, either through multiple pings in Discord or through dms. If any town member is unable to vote, then their vote is assumed to be a vote against. \n\nA simple majority of greater than 50% of town members is required (absences are considered votes against). Once that majority is secured, the stipulations of the vote immediately become a rule/law and will be placed below this document. As soon as \u003e50% of town members vote no, the vote fails and cannot be raised again for 3 more days.\n\n## The mayor[^3]\n\nThe mayor of the town is given ownership of the discord group, and has the responsibilities of being the town's \"spokesperson\", i.e. they will represent the town when speaking to foreign entities (i.e. student council, to be more specific yapes notes sponsored by the student council, gotta get that sponsorship ~~so i can sell my website and make money~~). The mayor has no other powers, and does not have the right to remove members of the town.\n\n## Election\nA snap election may be initiated at any time, but after a snap election fails the mayor gains a 5 day immunity. 3 successive failed snap election results in a 1 month immunity. This requires 1 person to challenge the mayor, with the support of at least 4 other people. Following this, the members of the town will participate in a vote between the challenger and the mayor. The challenger must get a strict majority (\u003e 50%, absentees are considered votes for the current mayor). If this is attained, the mayor must hand over ownership to the challenger. However, as the former mayor, they enjoy certain privileges until the next mayor after is elected, namely:\n- Immunity from being kicked\n- Immunity from being muted/server channel restriction (excluding cases in which they breach code of conduct e.g. spamming nsfw images)[^2]\n- The privileges given to a standard member of the town\nNote that attempting to circumvent this immunity is outlawed and immediately returns ownership to the previous owner (for example, by immediately transferring ownership, kicking them, and then regaining it), or by a collective consideration of the previous discord server being illegitimate.\n\n## Anti-bickering\nIn order to prevent deadlock due to splintered factionalism in the town, and to make sure a firm ruling on what makes rules \"equal\" or \"similar\" to each other, a town speaker[^1] will be elected, once again by a 50% majority in a vote. This will be decided like ~~the french election~~ a multi-stage electoral process, where candidates may initially run for speaker, and where consecutive rounds will occur where the candidate that receives the lowest amount of votes is removed from the election (This is essentially the process for the Tory leadership elections, cause why not its funny).\n\nThe roles of the speaker will be **mostly ceremonial**, *with the exception* that they have the final say on whether a proposed vote is too similar to any prior votes in the above mentioned time-frame that would prevent such a proposal from being voted on. \n\nAny votes related to the speaker, i.e. votes of no confidence, cannot be rejected by the speaker. However after two successive failed votes against the speaker, the speaker gains a 1 week immunity. In that 1 week period no votes related to the speaker may be proposed.\n\n## An important note\nBefore we go into the declaration of intent, I want to clarify how changes can be made. In a legal (if you consider there to even be laws) sense, anything related to the democratic function (the previous headings, i.e. from voting to anti-bickering inclusive) cannot be changed via vote, unless a 80% majority agrees to a proposed change. For anything else, i.e. adding things below that are unrelated to the democracy of the town, the above rules apply.\n\n## Declaration of intent\nThere was an intention in making the town, and while I wasn't exactly the founder of the static site group, per se, I will acknowledge Christian as the original founder, I do believe (fact check me if I'm wrong) that I did come up with the original idea for the \"town\", i.e. a collection of individuals who all have static sites, with the goal of collaboration and surviving \"the desert\" in mind. \n\nHowever, due to the current situation, I feel it is the right time to make some clarifications about the actual goals of the town, its fundamental tenets, and its requirements for membership.\n\n### Purpose\nTo foster a community of individuals who individually own a online medium for the distribution of notes. The goal is to exist independently from external entities and help each other cultivate their own notes.\n\n\n### Tenets\n- Town members co-exist as equals: as soon as someone becomes a town member, they have equal rights and say in the town.\n- While mild slander is acceptable, defamatory comments are frowned upon, and votes may be held to reprimand people who excessively use libel/slander through their notes medium.\n- NSFW content, as well as content that unduly harasses people or makes them uncomfortable, is banned. This includes any sexually explicit, violent, graphic, or offensive content (and especially inappropriate images from ~~redacted~~).\n\n## Requirements for membership\nIndividuals who individually own a online medium for the distribution of notes are applicable to be members.\n\nThis is including, and not limited to:\n- Jekyll websites\n- Quartz (Jekyll with modifications) websites\n- Zola (also Jekyll with modification) websites\n- Wix websites\n- Notion users\n\nThese notes need to be **relatively** accessible. I.e. if it is physically and theoretically possible to access them, then they meet the requirement.\nTown members can take down their websites temporarily (up to 5 days).\nIn order to join the town, members must submit an application (doesn't need to be too complicated), and members must vote on it. A simple majority will suffice, as long as most people vote and more people are in favour than against. If there are 3 or more people against allowing a person to join, the town will engage in a discussion in order to make the vote as unanimous as possible.\n\n## Removing members and reprimanding\nTo forcefully remove a member, a vote must be held that reaches a supportive majority of 70%, and a proper reason must be given (e.g. violation of the rules). If this is for joke purposes, the member *must* be timed-out and/or restricted to a few channels via a removable role.\nMembers can leave at any time, but those who do are not necessarily immediately reinstated if they change their mind.\n\nTo mute or temporarily suspend the membership of an individual, a vote must garner a 60% majority. This kind of \"censor\" vote cannot be held against either the mayor or the speaker.\n\n[^1]: The town speaker cannot be the mayor. There is an obvious conflict of interest.\n[^2]: If additional restrictions are to be placed on the mayor in future, they must be voted on within the same vote to remove the mayor.\n[^3]: The mayor can be called the mayo if you want to call them the mayo",

The reaction is highly exothermic, and the heat given out by the reaction is sufficient to maintain the temperature needed to give a fast rate. \n\nThe system is at equilibrium until t1 and then at t1, the volume of the vessel is reduced at constant temperature.

To determine the mass of $HCl$ dropped, the technician took a $22.10 mL$ solution of $HCl$ and titrated this solution with standardised $0.1210 molL$ $NaOH$ solution. The titration was carried out using a pH monitoring machine. The titration was stopped when $35.40mL$ of $NaOH$ has been added. At this point the pH of the resulting solution was measured to be exactly 9.7 as excess $NaOH$ had been added and thus the solution was now a consistent pink(as phenolphthalein indicator was used).\"\n\na) Determine the concentration of $HCl$ in ppm that was present in the swimming pool after the mishap if the density of the poll solution is $1.318gmL^{-1}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-9.7}=1.995\\times 10^{-10} molL^{-1} \\\\\n\\text{Assume }25\\degree C\\text{, }\\therefore K_{w}=[H^{+}][OH^{-}], \\therefore [OH^{-} ] =\\frac{1\\times \\times 10^{-14}}{1.995\\times 10^{-10}}=5.01\\times 10^{-5}molL^{-1} \\\\\nn=cV, \\therefore n(OH^{-}) = 5.01\\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.02210= 1.11\\times 10^{-6}mol \\\\\nn=CV, \\therefore n(OH^{-} \\text{ added}) = 0.1210\\times 0.03540=4.28\\times 10^{-3} mol\\\\\n\\therefore n(OH^{-} \\text{reacted}) = n(OH^{-} \\text{ added}) - n(OH^{-}) = 4.28\\times 10^{-3} - 1.11\\times 10^{-6} = 4.28 \\times 10^{-3} mol \\\\\nOH^{-} + HCl \\to Cl^{-} + H_{2}O \\\\\n\\therefore \\text{1:1 ratio, } n(HCl) = n(OH^{-}) = 4.28 \\times 10^{-3}mol \\\\\n\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nb) THe person carrying out the titration noticed that the pH metre recorded a sharp increase near the equivalence point but as the volume of $NaOH$ added increased and the solution colour remained pink, the pH maintained at a very high value and increased gradually. Explain these two observations with reference to the appropriate chemical principals. You may refer to the pH curve given.\n\n(The pH curve given starts acidic and goes basic, equivalence is at neutral (7))\n",

    "content": "\nthings in italics (*these things*) are extension\n\n**Topics:**\n- Periodic Table and Bonding\n\t- See [History of the Atomic Model Notes](History%20of%20the%20Atomic%20Model%20Notes.md)\n\t- What does Valency mean (vs valence electrons)?\n\t\t- **Valency:** The **combining power** of an atom, and is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine with or displace.\n\t\t- Number of valence electrons refer to the **number of electrons** in an atom's Valence (outer) shell.\n\t\t- e.g. Nitrogen has a valency of -3, but has 5 valence electrons.\n\t- How the periodic table works\n\t\t- The periodic table is ordered in a way that reflects its electronic structure.\n\t\t\t- **Period number** represents the number of electron shells of an element.\n\t\t\t\t- e.g. Calcium has an electron configuration (standard notation) of 2, 8, 8, 2. From this, we know that Calcium has 4 electron shells. Thus, Calcium has a period number of 4.\n\t\t\t- **Group number** represents the number of **valence electrons** of an element.\n\t\t\t\t- There are exceptions: e.g. the transition metals, however for yr 10 you don't need to know about why that happens.\n\t\t\t\t- For example, Chlorine has a group number of 17, however if we pretend the transition metals don't exist, it would have a group number of 7. Thus, Chlorine would have 7 valence electrons. Chlorine's electron configuration is 2, 8, 7 and does indeed have 7 valence electrons.\n\t- 3 (main) types of bonding:\n\t\t- But why do elements bond? In general, atoms want to each a **stable electron configuration**. What that means is that they want their **outer** (valence) shell to be **full** of electrons (in general this is 8). They can do this in a variety of ways, by losing, gaining or sharing electrons.\n\t\t- We can also say they want the electron configuration of a **noble gas**, as noble gasses already have this configuration.\n\t\t- *Note that bonding works on a spectrum of sorts. We can have pure metallic on one side, pure ionic in the middle, and pure covalent on the other side. However, there will always be certain compounds/molecules that do not fit in this category. E.g. $SiO_2$ can be considered 'covalent', however due to Silicon being a metalloid, $SiO_2$ (silica) is actually a covalent **network** substance, unlike the molecules you will encounter in yr 10.*\n\t\t- Ionic bonding:\n\t\t\t- Between metals and non-metals.\n\t\t\t- *When metals and non-metals collide, metals will lose their valence electrons to form positive ions (cations), and non-metals will accept these ions, forming negative ions (anions). These ions then form a lattice of alternating ions.*\n\t\t\t- *There is an electrostatic force of attraction between unlike ions, however there is a repulsive force between like ions.*\n\t\t\t- *The lattice is organised so that there is a greater distance between like ions. As electrostatic forces decrease in strength with an increase in distance, this reduces the repulsive force.*\n\t\t\t- *Thus, a net attractive force exists within the ionic lattice. This is called the ionic bond.*\n\t\t\t- *Note that the ionic lattice is 3 dimensional.*\n\t\t\t- ![[Pasted image 20220504191955.png]]\n\t\t- Metallic bonding:\n\t\t\t- Only between metals\n\t\t\t- *In metallic solids, metal atoms decide to lose their valence electrons to form positive ions.*\n\t\t\t- *The term used to describe these electrons, which do not orbit any atom and are freely moving, is ==delocalised==. \n\t\t\t- *Thus, this produces an array of metallic cations surrounded by a ==sea of delocalised electrons==.*\n\t\t\t- *Note that the 'metallic bond' is the ==electrostatic force of attraction between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons==.*\n\t\t\t- *Thus, the bond is non-directional.*\n\t\t\t- ![[Pasted image 20220504192150.png]]\n\t\t- Covalent Bonding:\n\t\t\t- Only between non-metals\n\t\t\t- *Non-metal atoms can share electrons to produce a shared pair of electrons.*\n\t\t\t- *The covalent bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between a shared pair of electrons produced by 2 atoms, and the 2 atoms' nuclei.*\n\n\t* Properties of elements (position $\\rightarrow$ properties)\n\t\t* In general, elements closer to the left have a greater **metallic** nature. Elements closer to the right have a weaker metallic nature.\n\t\t* **Metallic nature** refers to the readiness of an atom to lose its valence electrons, like how most metals lose their valence electrons to produce the metallic structure.\n\t\t* In terms of chemical reactivity: \n\t\t\t* For metals, elements become more reactive as they get closer to the **bottom right** corner of the periodic table.\n\t\t\t* For non-metals, elements become more reactive as they get closer to the **bottom right** corner.\n\t\t\t\t* This does not include the noble gasses, as they are inert and do not react well.\n\t* Nomenclature:\n\t\t* Metals formulae:\n\t\t\t* Just write the metal's symbol.\n\t\t\t* e.g. $Ag_{(s)}$\n\t\t* Metals nomenclature:\n\t\t\t* Just state the metal.\n\t\t\t* e.g. Silver\n\t\t* Ionic formulae:\n\t\t\t* Write both metal and non-metal ions, but **balance it** so that the total charge of the compound is 0.\n\t\t\t* e.g. $BaCl$ would be wrong, because Barium has a charge of 2+ and Chlorine has a charge of 1-. This would result in a +1 charge.\n\t\t\t* The correct formulae for Barium chloride is $BaCl_2$.\n\t\t\t* Positive ions come before negative ions.\n\t\t\t\t* **Unless** the negative ion is $CH_3COO^-$. In this case, we put the positive ion last.\n\t\t\t\t\t* *This is because the cation is not attracted to the initial carbon, which has 4 covalent bonds to 3 hydrogens and the other carbon, and thus has an stable electron configuration.*\n\t\t\t\t\t* *Instead, the last oxygen is actually the atom that is negatively charged. Thus, we place the positive ion last to indicate that it is bonded with the charged oxygen atom, not the carbon atom.*\n\t\t* Ionic nomenclature:\n\t\t\t* Just state the positive and negative ions, in that order. \n\t\t\t* e.g. Barium Chloride\n\t\t\t* Do not include charges\n\t\t\t* e.g. Barium 2+ Chloride - is wrong\n\t\t\t\t* UNLESS the positive ion is a **transition metal**. Then, we have to indicate its valency via roman numerals.\n\t\t\t\t* This should be easy to figure out, as you'll be given the ionic compound as a formulae or will be told its valency.\n\t\t\t\t* e.g. if we were asked to write the name of $Cu(OH)_2$, from this formula we would be able to deduce Copper's valency in this case to be 2+. Thus, $Cu(OH)_2$'s name would be Copper (II) Hydroxide.\n\t\t* Covalent formulae\n\t\t\t* Write the elements with the number of elements as subscript.\n\t\t\t* e.g. Diphosphorus pentoxide is $P_2O_5$.\n\t\t* Covalent nomenclature\n\t\t\t* For every element, we use a prefix to describe the number of atoms of said element in the given molecule.\n\t\t\t* The prefixes are (in order of increasing number of atoms (mono = 1)):\n\t\t\t\t* Mono\n\t\t\t\t* Di\n\t\t\t\t* Tri\n\t\t\t\t* Tetra\n\t\t\t\t* Penta\n\t\t\t\t* Hexa\n\t\t\t\t* Hepta\n\t\t\t\t* Octa\n\t\t\t\t* Nona\n\t\t\t\t* Deca\n\t\t\t* HOWEVER, the prefix **mono** is never used for the **first element**.\n\t\t\t* The **second element** will end with an 'ide' prefix. (root name of the element + _ide_)\n\t\t\t* e.g. $SO_2$ would be Sulfur *di*ox*ide*.\n\t\t\t\t* The important details have been italicised. \t\n- Types of Reaction\n- Stoichiometry",

Melting point is an indicator of the energy required to separate particles into a liquid or gaseous form.\n* Hardness: In chemistry, we think of hardness as the relative strength of the chemical bonds within a substance. In other words, it is how resistant a solid is to force applied.\n* Density: how compact the particles in a molecule are.\n* Electrical conductivity: The ability for a substance to conduct a current of electricity. For a substance to be conductive, it must contain **mobile, charged particles**.\n* Thermal conductivity: The transfer of energy due to molecular motion. For a substance to conduct heat, generally it must have mobile particles to transfer energy.\n* Brittle: To be hard, but fracture easily.\n\n\n**Solutions:**\n\t- **Solution:** A mixture in which the solute particles are homogenously distributed throughout particles of solvent\n\t      - Can be solid (e.g. Bronze(Metal alloys)), liquid (e.g. Sea water) or gas (e.g. Air)\n\t- **Aqueous Solution:** Liquid solution where the solvent is water\n\t- **Solvent:** The major component of a solution by mass\n    - **Solute:** The minor components of a solution by mass\n    - **Dissolving:** Solid particles are separated and distributed throughout the mixture, increasing solution concentration.\n    - **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    - **Saturated:** Contain the same amount of solute that the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n\t    - Rate of dissolving and crystallisation are equal\n\t- **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n\t\t- Can be achieved through heating and dissolving, then carefully cooling the solution.\n\n**Pure substances:** A substance that has a fixed composition. This includes elements and compounds.S\n\n**Valency:** The **combining power** of an atom, and is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine with or displace.\n\n**Precipitate:** An insoluble solid produced by two solutions being added together.\n\n**Mole:** The amount of particles of a substance that is equal to the number of particles in 12 grams of Carbon-12.\n\n**Physical Properties Copy-Paste Moment**\n\n- **Ionic Bonding:**\n\t- **High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- Within the ionic lattice, there exists a strong electrostatic attractive force between unlike ions. Thus, a high average kinetic energy of particles is required to separate these ions into the liquid and gaseous phase. As energy is proportional to temperature, this means ionic compounds will have a higher melting/boiling point. \n\t- **Hardness and Brittleness**\n\t\t- When force is applied to the ionic lattice, layers of alternating ions slide over each other. This causes the distance between like charges to decrease, creating a net repulsive force. This fractures the ionic lattice, making ionic compounds brittle. However, the strong electrostatic attractive force between unlike ions still remains, and requires much more force to break. Thus, ionic substances are hard.\n\t- **Conductivity in Solid, Liquid and Aqueous states**\n\t\t- For a substance to be conductive, it must contain mobile, charged particles.\n\t\t- In the solid state:\n\t\t\t- Ionic solids exist as an lattice of alternating ions.\n\t\t\t- These ions are rigid with regards to the overall structure.\n\t\t\t- As these ions are rigid, they are not mobile despite being charged.\n\t\t\t- Thus, ionic substances are not conductive in the solid phase.\n\t\t- In the molten phase:\n\t\t\t- In the molten phase, ions have high kinetic energy and are free to move **independently**.\n\t\t\t- As ions they are charged (positive or negative).\n\t\t\t- Thus, in the molten phase ionic compounds are very conductive.\n\t\t- In the aqueous phase:\n\t\t\t- Ions are attracted to water molecules, which move freely. This means ions are also mobile in an aqueous solution.\n\t\t\t- Ions are also charged.\n\t\t\t- Thus, in the aqueous phase ionic compounds are very conductive.\n\t- **Comparison Question**\n\t\t- e.g. Element X is a Group 1 element, Element Y is a group 2 element. Which one has the stronger metallic bond?\n\t\t\t- Element Y. As it releases more valence electrons, it becomes more positively charged. Thus, a greater electrostatic force of attraction will exist between Element Y's cations and the sea of delocalised electrons, i.e., the metallic bond. Thus, the metallic bond will be stronger.\n\n- **Metallic Bonding:**\n\t- **Malleability and Ductility**\n\t\t- The metallic bond is non-directional, as it is between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons.\n\t\t- This means when force is applied, cations can **move in relation to each other** without breaking the metallic bond.\n\t\t- Thus, metals can change shape without breaking, and thus are highly malleable and ductile.\n\t- **Thermal and Electrical Conductivity**\n\t\t- Thermal:\n\t\t\t- To be a thermal conductor, a substance must contain mobile particles to transfer energy via collisions.\n\t\t\t- Within metal solids, there is a sea of delocalised electrons.\n\t\t\t- These electrons are mobile, and thus can carry kinetic(heat) energy.\n\t\t\t- Furthermore, metal cations can vibrate, which further carries kinetic energy.\n\t\t\t- Thus, metals are good thermal conductors.\n\t- **Moderate to High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- With a metal solid, there exists a strong electrostatic force of attraction between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons. Thus, a high average kinetic energy of particles is required to disrupt the metallic lattice. As energy is proportional to temperature, this means metal solids will have a higher melting/boiling point.\n\n- **Covalent Molecular Bonding:**\n\t- **Low Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- For covalent molecular substances, there exists a very strong intramolecular force within molecules, but a weak intermolecular force between molecules. Thus, less energy is required to overcome this weak force and separate molecules. As energy is proportional to temperature, covalent molecular substances have a low melting/boiling point.\n\t- **Non-conductivity**\n\t\t- For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile, charged particles. In covalent molecules, electrons remain localised either as within an atom's electron cloud or as part of a shared pair of electrons in a covalent bond. Thus, there are no delocalised electrons, which would be mobile and charged. Furthermore, there are no ions. Thus, there are no mobile charged particles and covalent molecular substances are not electrically conductive.\n\t- **Softness and Brittleness** \n\t\t- When force is applied to a covalent molecular substance, the weak intermolecular forces are easily overcome, and molecules are separated from each other. This makes covalent molecular substances soft. Furthermore, as this weak intermolecular structure is easily overcome. this makes covalent molecular substances very brittle.\n\n- **Covalent Network Bonding:**\n\t- **High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- Within a covalent network substance, strong covalent bonds exist between all atoms within the structure. For this structure to be disrupted, a large amount of **particle kinetic energy** is required. As energy is proportional to temperature, covalent network substances will have a very high melting/boiling point.\n\t- **Hardness and Brittleness**\n\t\t- A lot of force is required to disrupt atoms in a covalent network substance. Thus, these substances are hard and brittle, as applying such a force would fracture the network.\n\t- **Thermal and Electrical Conductivity**\n\t\t- Thermal:\n\t\t\t- To conduct heat, a substance must contain mobile particles to carry kinetic energy. Electrons are rigid in the covalent network structure, either as part of lone pairs or bonding pairs. The atoms are also held in place. Thus, there are no mobile particles present to carry kinetic energy and thus these substances are thermally non-conductive.\n\t\t- Electrical:\n\t\t\t- To conduct electricity, a substance must contain charged particles. Electrons are rigid in the covalent network structure, either as part of lone pairs or bonding pairs. The atoms are also held in place. Thus, there are no mobile charged particles and thus these substances are not electrically conductive. \n**Intermolecular Forces and Solubility**:\n- ",

They're good to briefly read as revision, and they're definitely better than Pearson, but other than that, they aren't too great.\n\t- Their sets are **long**. But the extended questions are where its at, and their answers are *top-tier*. Would definitely recommend tackling Lucarelli first when learning a new topic, just as consolidation and getting used to the style of questions for said topic.\n\t- Overall, Lucarelli (**Essential Chemistry** is its official name, btw) is a great buy.\n\n## Number 2: Chemistry Past papers\n- 8/10. The best way in getting better in chemistry (well I think so anyways, its not working out too well for me... :( ) is doing practice papers. Just remember to be harsh on yourself if you don't have a marking key, and in general don't be generous to yourself.\n- psst I do have a [github for chemistry papers](https://github.com/EddieTheEd/ATAR-Yr11-Exams-Tests), if you want it to be a proper website how about you go and find your own papers, huh?\n\n## Number 3: WACE Study Guide\n- 7/10. It fulfils its purpose as a revision guide, but that's all.\n\t- Its short summary pages suck. The diagrams and stuff are decent, but the rest is either common knowledge or things you probably should know already ~~unless you haven't been studying~~. \n\t- Review questions are mediocre. Good for some quick revision though. But don't rely on the answers. Let them guide you to the correct solution, but use your common sense on how much marks the question is/how long the answer should be. This depends on the topic.\n\t- Trial tests are awesome. They somewhat correlate to the difficulty of actual tests, and always come with an answer key. \n\t- Overall, I recommend buying the book, only because its trial tests are great.\n\n## Number 4: STAWA\n- *Man, I hate this book.*\n- 5/10. Don't bother reading through the experiments, the sets are where its at.\n\t- STAWA sets are repetitive, boring, and lengthy. Good for some topics, not good for others.\n\t- **DO NOT READ THE ANSWERS FOR STAWA SETS. THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG.** \n\t- Try and find 'worked solutions for STAWA' online or from your friends.\n\t- Overall, I would recommend trying to find an online copy of STAWA, but buying it is a last resort. For some reason, my hard copy's binder just disintegrated within mere weeks of buying it. That probably explains my negative attitude towards the book...\n\n## Number 5: Pearson\n- *I have nightmares thinking about Pearson chapters...*\n- 3/10. I absolutely hate this book. It has no merits, yet for some reason all schools recommend buying it.\n\t- Questions suck. That's all. Questions like \"3. Why does Australia store more water per person than any other country?\" (pg 344, Chapter 15.1 Review) fill me with dread. Their answers aren't better either.\n\t- Reading through some of these chapters are what I recall as some of the worst hours of my life. Having learned about 'flocculation' and fluoridation, and how Sodium Hexafluoride is added to drinking water to supposedly \"harden tooth enamel\", I think its safe to say this book is horrible.\n\t- Overall, you may end up buying it because it's required by your school. But please, try avoiding buying it at all costs. Do not give the people who wrote it any more money.\n\n",

    "title": "Chemistry Stoichiometry Notes",
    "content": "\nBefore starting to learn about stoichiometry, think about this little analogy.\n\nLet's say I have two cubes, one being 100 grams of pure Carbon, and another being 100 grams of Aluminium.\n\nNow, are there the same number of atoms within both of the cubes?\n\nNo, because Carbon, being a lighter element, will require more atoms to maintain a specific weight than a metal such as Aluminium.\n\n\nThis is where **moles** come in. Essentially, moles are an intermediary unit to describe the relationship between molar mass (which is basically a measurement of relative atomic mass between elements) and mass (in grams).\n\nNow, if you have a periodic table, you might notice some numbers under elements. This is the **relative atomic mass** of an element (this number is based on the average natural abundance of this element which is analysed using mass spectrometry (you don't need this)). \n\nWe could measure everything in grams, but then all our calculations would use *really* small numbers, that would be overly complicated to use for calculations. (e.g. Carbon-12 weighs $1.9926 \\times 10^{-23}$g)\n\nInstead, we use **relative atomic mass** to compare the mass of an element with the mass of **one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom**. \n\nThus, for example, we would describe Chlorine's *relative atomic mass* as 35.45, as the average atom of Chlorine is 35.45 times the mass of one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom.\n\n\nSimilarly, we have another unit called **molar mass** (M). It is defined as:\n\n\u003eThe mass of one mole of an element's atoms.\n\nBut what is a mole?\n\nAs said before, a mole is a unit we use to connect number of atoms to grams.\n\nEssentially, a mole of **any element** has a mass that is equal to its **relative atomic mass**, in grams.\n\nFor example, if I had one mole of Carbon, I would have exactly 12.01 grams of Carbon. (its relative atomic mass is 12.01)\n\u003eNote: Similarly, One mole of Carbon-12 is 12 grams (Carbon-12 on its on has a relative atomic mass of 12).\n\nThat's cool and all, but surely there has to be some universal constant to represent this.\n\nWell, **relative atomic mass** is based on **one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom**. So naturally, we need some equivalent in describing a mole.\n\nThis is where **Avogadro's Number** comes in.\n\nAvogadro's Number is the exact quantity of Carbon-12 atoms to have a mass of 12 grams.\n\nIn general,\n\n\u003eAvogadro's number represents the number of an element's atoms required to have a mass of that element's relative atomic mass.\n\nHaving this quantity of an element is equivalent to a **mole** of that element.\n\nTherefore, given that Molar Mass is the **mass of one mole of its atoms**, and a **mole** is related to **relative atomic mass**, unsurprisingly **Molar Mass** and **Relative atomic mass** are **exactly the same!**\n\nExcept that molar mass is measured in grams per mole, whereas Relative atomic mass does not have a unit of measurement, as its *relative*. \n\nThus, if I had 22.99 grams of Sodium, which is numerically equivalent to the Molar mass of Sodium (and Sodium's relative atomic mass), I would also have 1 mole of Sodium, which has Avogadro's number of atoms.\n\nNow, here's a quick question:\n\nWhat's the molar mass of oxygen *gas*?\n\n\nWell, we know that oxygen gas contains two atoms of oxygen. This is because oxygen is diatomic. We also know that molar mass is exactly the same as Relative atomic mass.\n\nThe Relative Atomic Mass of Oxygen is 16.00, but this is for a single atom. We're looking for the relative atomic mass of 2 atoms, so we just **times by 2**.\n\nTherefore, the Molar mass of Oxygen is 32.00 $g\\ mol^{-1}$. *Remember to write $g\\ mol^{-1}$!*\n\n\nHere's a harder question:\n\nWhat's the molar mass of Sulphuric acid?\n\nFirst, let's identify the following:\n1. What elements are we looking for\n2. What ratio are these elements present in\n\nSulphuric acid's formula is $H_2SO_4$.\n\nThus, there are:\n* 2 Hydrogen atoms\n* 1 Sulfur atom\n* 4 Oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, we can write each of the element's Molar mass (i.e. its relative atomic mass (i use relative atomic mass cause its alot easier)) and like before, multiply it by how many atoms there are of the element.\n\n$2 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 32.07 + 4 \\times 16.00$\n\n= 98.086 $g\\ mol^{-1}$.\n\n\nNow that's done, you're ready for one of the most easiest formulas in the world.\n\n```ad-info\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}$\n\n```\nwhere:\n* n = number of moles, measured in moles (mol)\n* m = mass, measured in grams (g)\n* M = molar mass, measured in grams per mole ($g\\ mol^{-1}$)\n\nThis formula will covert grams to moles, and moles to grams, so you can have the best of both worlds (i.e. a unit of measurement used everywhere and a unit of measurement that can be converted to number of atoms easily)\n\nNow, example question:\n\nWhat is the number of atoms in 50 grams of Silver Ethanoate ($CH_3COOAg$)(btw Ms Pilling said for ethanoates you put the cation at the end. Something to do with the way ethanoates bond as a polyatomic ion)\n\nFirst, there are:\n* 2 Carbon atoms (12.01)\n* 3 Hydrogen atoms (1.008)\n* 2 Oxygen atoms (16.00)\n* 1 Silver atom (107.868)\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of Silver Ethanoate is:\n\n$2 \\times 12.01 + 3 \\times 1.008 + 2 \\times 16.00 + 1 \\times 107.868$\n\nWhich is 166.912 $g\\ mol^{-1}$.\n\nBut we're not done yet! Now we can use our amazing formula:\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n = \\frac{50}{166.912}$\n\nThus, the number of moles in 50g of Silver Ethanoate is 0.2996 **mol**.\n\nTherefore, since a mole represents $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms, \n\nThen number of atoms in 50g of Silver Ethanoate is:\n\n$0.29776 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$\n\nWhich is: $1.804 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms!\n\n\nOk, now you understand basic stoichiometry, and moles to grams conversions. But what about moles inside of moles?\n\nLet's say I had 2 moles of Sulphuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). How many moles of Hydrogen atoms are contained inside?\n\nWell, the answer is surprisingly very simple. We look at the **subscript** of the element we're looking for. In this case, Hydrogen's subscript is 2, so we simply **multiply** the moles of the **whole molecule** by the subscript.\n\nThus, the number of Hydrogen moles is **4**.\n\nSimilarly the number of Sulphate ion ($SO_4^{-2}$) moles is **2**. (There is only one molecule of Sulphate) (Imagine $H_2SO_{4}$ as $H_2(SO_4)_1$)\n\nAlso, the number of Oxygen moles is 8. (Oxygen has a subscript of 4.)\n\nOk, time to throw you in the deep end.\n\n\nI have 5 kilograms of Nitric Acid ($HNO_{3(aq)}$) and I mixed it with an excess amount of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH_{aq}$). \n\nFind all the products of this reaction, and find how many moles of Sodium Nitrate are produced (hint hint sodium nitrate is one of the products)\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we write the equation:\n\n$HNO_{3(aq)} + NaOH_{s} \\rightarrow NaNO_{3(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)}$ \n\nNote that the ratio between all the reactants and products is: **1 : 1 : 1 :1**\n\n\nNow here's the thing about moles within chemical formulas:\n\nLet's say I had 2 substances in my chemical reaction. They could be **any** of the substances, reactants or products.\n\nLet's call them aA, and bB, where the small letters are the coefficients and the big elements are the substances.\n\n(In our case, we'll choose Nitric Acid and Sodium Nitrate.)\n\nNow, here's another amazingly simple formula:\n\nFor two **substances** in an equation (aA, bB),\n\n```ad-info \n$n(A) = \\frac{a}{b} \\times n(B)$\n```\n\n\nThus, \n\n$n(HNO_{3(aq)})= \\frac{1}{1} \\times n(NaNO_{3(aq)})$\n\n$\\therefore n(HNO_{3(aq)})= n(NaNO_{3(aq)})$\n\nOk, now we need to actually calculate the number of moles of Nitric Acid:\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n=\\frac{5000}{1 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 14.01 + 3 \\times 16.00}$\n\n$\\therefore n(HNO_{3(aq)}) = 79.342$ mol.\n\n$\\therefore n(NaNO_{3(aq)})=$ ==79.342 mol.== (1:1 ratio)\n\nGreat! You understand the basics of stoichiometry now. \n\nHere are a few practice questions:\n\n\n1. For a science experiment, I burn 4 moles of ethanol ($C_2H_6O_{(l)}$) in an open flame. How much moles of oxygen is consumed, assuming complete combustion (yea there are other types of combustion .-.)?\n2. Pure oxygen is prepared for laboratory use through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (sidenote, its catalytic) in the following formula: $2H_2O_{2(aq)} \\rightarrow O_{2(g)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$                                                    If I needed 20 grams of oxygen gas for an experiment, how many moles of hydrogen peroxide would I need?\n3. Given the formula: $Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} \\rightarrow CO_{2(g)} + 11H_2O_{(l)} + 2NaCl_{(aq)}$ How many **grams** of Sodium Carbonate-10-water produces 60 grams of Sodium Chloride?\n\n **Answers:** (don't look if you actually want to do it yourself, otherwise I guess you can see how I would do it)\n\n1. First, write the chemical equation:\n\n$2C_2H_6OH_{(l)} + 6O_{2(g)} \\rightarrow 4CO_{2(g)} + 6H_2O_{(l)}$ \n\nNote the 2 : 6 : 4 : 6 ratio.\n\nI'm comparing ethanol and oxygen. Therefore, I'm looking at a 2 to 6 ratio.\n\nTherefore, $n(O_{2(g)}) = \\frac{6}{2} \\times n(C_2H_6OH_{(l)})$\n\n= $\\frac{6}{2} \\times 4$ = ==12 mol.==\n\n2. First, we're in grams so I'm going to convert into moles (in general you should always convert into moles, at least you'll get a mark for that)\n\n$n=\\frac{m}{m}, n(O_{2(g)})=\\frac{20}{2\\times16} = 0.625$ mol.\n\nTherefore, \n\n$n(H_2O_{2(aq)}) = \\frac{2}{1}\\times n(O_{2(g)})$\n\n= ==1.25 mol.==\n\n3. Convert grams to moles.\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n(NaCl_{(aq)}) = \\frac{60}{22.99 + 35.45} = 1.0267$ mol.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$n(Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\times n(NaCl_{(aq)})=0.51335$ mol.\n\nHowever, we're looking for **grams**. Thus, we have to reconvert from moles to grams.\n\n$n=\\frac{m}{M}, m=nM, m(Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)})=0.51335 \\times (2 \\times 22.99 + 1 \\times 12.01 + 3 \\times 16 + 10(2 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 16))$ (preferably its not on one giant line)\n\n= 146.89 **g**!\n\n\nGreat! Now you have a relatively good understanding of basic stoichiometry. \n\n\n\nNow, time for **gasses.**\n\nRemember that laboratory question about oxygen? Perhaps you noticed something wrong about measuring oxygen in grams. You would be correct, as in general, we do not have oxygen in solid form, which is what we use grams for. \n\nInstead, since oxygen is a gas, it occupy **volume**. \n\nInstead of grams, we use **litres**. \n\nSounds logical, right? All we need to do is change the grams to litres, change some numbers around and everything will be fine, right?\n\nNo.\n\nGasses are influenced by both **temperature** and **pressure**.\n\nIf I increase the temperature of a gas, following the kinetic theory of gas, then on average gas particles will have more kinetic energy, making them spread out and thus want to occupy more space (if they don't get this space, pressure increases but you don't need to know that).\n\nSimilarly, increasing pressure will reduce the volume of a gas. Think about it as you're crushing gas particles in some sort of compressor. Adding pressure will push the particles closer.\n\nWe measure pressure in pascals (Pa).\n\nFor example, average atmospheric pressure at sea level is described as 101.325 kPa, which is equivalent to one standard atmosphere (atm) of pressure.\n\nWe measure temperature in kelvin (K) (actually we usually use degrees Celcius). \n\nWhat makes kelvin useful is the concept of absolute zero.\n\nHere's a side-note about absolute zero you can read if you're really interested:\n\n```ad-info\nThe Kinetic theory of gasses states that all particles usually have some form of motion. This motion accounts for the 'heat' of the particles, e.g. in high temperatures particles would move faster than if they were at lower temperatures, assume the particles remain the same element. \n\nThe idea of absolute zero is that, theoretically, even though substances can be gasses, there exists a state where all particles of matter become motionless. They would be much like a solid (at that temperature they pretty much are), but there would be no lattices or bonds between separate particles.\n\n**This also means that ideal gasses at absolute zero have no volume**. Emphasis on ideal, as the concept of an ideal gas revolves around the idea that their particles have negligible volume, and are not affected by attraction/repulsion. \n\nThus, ideal gasses at absolute zero have no kinetic energy, and no volume.\n```\n\nNote: Temperature(kelvin) = Temperature(degrees celcius) + 273.15\n\nTo measure some molar amount of a gas, given that volume is influenced by both temperature and pressure, we have to use some constant of both temperature and pressure.\n\nIUPAC (big science people) recommends the **standard temperature and pressure** (STP). \n\nThis describes gasses at 273.15 K or 0$\\degree C$, and at a pressure of 100 kPa.\n\nGiven a gas at STP,\n\n**One mole -\u003e 22.71 L**\n\nThis applies **regardless** of the type of gas, except it only applies for gasses at STP.\n\nThus, we have a new formula:\n\n```ad-info\n$n=\\frac{V_{stp}}{22.71}$\n```\n\nwhere n = number of moles (mol)\nV = Volume of gas at STP (L)\n\nCongratulations! Now you can convert for grams to moles, moles to grams, litres to moles, and moles to litres.\n",

    "content": "\nChromatography is a laboratory technique for **separation** and **identification**.\n\nTypes of Chromatography include:\n- **GC/GLC** - Gas (Liquid) Chromatography\n- **HPLC** - High Performance Liquid Chromatography\n- **Paper Chromatography**\n- **TLC** - Thin Layered Chromatography\n- *Column Chromatography*\n\n**In all examples of chromatography:**\n- There exists a **stationary** and **mobile** phase.\n- Separation of substances relies on **solubiilty**.\n\t- In general, if a substance is more soluble in the mobile phase in comparison to the substance's desire to **adsorb** (bind to a surface) to the stationary phase.\n\n**Paper Chromatography**\n- Is used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments.\n- Procedure (dyes in ink mixture):\n\t- We put the mixture on a **line of origin**\n\t\t- Note that we do not place the line of origin within the solvent, as the mixture would simply dissolve in the solvent and not move up the stationary phase.\n\t- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture.\n\t- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the mixture's pattern.\n- The solvent(mobile phase) is drawn up the paper by **capillary action**.\n- In general, paper chromatography uses **polarity** of the substances.\n\t- The chromatography paper (stat. phase) is usually very polar.\n\t- Polar substances in a mixture will be more attracted to the stationary phase and thus will adsorb and not move with the mobile phase as much.\n\t- Non-polar substances are less attracted, and thus do not adsorb well and can be dissolved in the mobile phase, and move greatly along with the mobile phase.\n- This form of chromatography is most useful if the substances involved have distinct colours.\n\n**Thin-Layered Chromatography**\n- In TLC, the stationary phase is a layer of silica gel fixed onto a glass plate.\n- The mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substances.\n- Has the same principles as paper chromatography.\n- TLC involves a stable silica gel, but paper in paper chromatography is flexible and might affect results of chromatography. In TLC, the glass plate does not bend, and thus you will have better results.\n- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix; however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix.\n- A dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and caries it up the matrix with it.\n- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to he silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent\n- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.\n\n**Gas Chromatography:**\n- Used for identifying substances and their concentrations in stable mixtures (ones that do not decompose)\n\t- Mobile phase: **inert carrier gas**\n\t\t- Helium\n\t\t- Nitrogen\n\t\t- Hydrogen\n\t- Stationary phase: **High BP viscous liquid** (that stays liquid(non-volatile))\n- Retention **time** is based on **volatility** of **analytes** in the mixture.\n\t- More volatile analytes prefer to remain as gas (vapour), and thus are carried by the carrier gas and leave the chromatography chamber easily.\n\t- The opposite applies for less volatile analytes\n\t- Note that **volatility** is highly related to **boiling-point**, which is in turn related to **intermolecular forces**.\n\t\t- **Stronger** **intermolecular forces** leads to a **higher** **boiling point**. Substances that have a high boiling point are less likely to remain in the gaseous state, and thus have a **low** **volatility**.\n\t- Retention time is also impacted by the column's **temperature**, as **high temperature** tends to **increase volatility** and thus **retention time decreases**.\n- As analytes leave the column, they are analysed by a detector.\n- When all analytes have left the chamber, data collated by the detector can be analysed to produce a **chromatogram**.\n- *When used with Mass spectrometry, gas chromatography becomes highly accurate identifier of compounds.*\n- *Flame ionization detector (FID) is a commonly used detector that give retention time.*\n\n**HPLC:**\n- HPLC is for mixtures that easily decompose, or have extremely low volatility (prefer to be liquid/solid rather than gas)\n- Mobile phase: **liquid solvent** (usually non-polar in normal)\n- Stationary phase: **fine particles of $SiO_2$**.",

    "content": "\n# Computer Science Exam Prep (Monolithic Document)\nHere is a monolithic document that contains all of my Computer Science notes, which I made in preparation for the Semester 1 Exam.\n\n**Some Good Links:**\n- [GCSE Computer Science - BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/subjects/z34k7ty)\n- Your respective OneNotes\n\n## Computing Systems\nFor computing systems, there are 2 main categories that things can go into, these are:\n- **Hardware**\n- **Software**\n\nFrom here you can go into more detail, and here is all the main course content that you need to know:\n\n### Hardware:\n- ***What is the Processing Architecture?***\n\t- This is a system which involves having an 'input', some form of 'processing', and then some form of 'output'. This is seen in all common computers. A simpler way of visualising this is as below:\n\t\t- **Input -\u003e Computer/Processing -\u003e Output**\n\t\t\t- ***What is an 'Input'?***\n\t\t\t\t- An input is a device/piece of hardware that gets information of some kind. \n\t\t\t\t- *Examples of Input Devices:*\n\t\t\t\t\t- scanners\n\t\t\t\t\t- keyboard\n\t\t\t\t\t- mouse\n\t\t\t\t\t- touch-screen\n\t\t\t\t\t- sensors\n\t\t\t\t\t- etc.\n\t\t\t\t- This forms a vital part of computers, as this allows for information such as keystrokes from a keyboard, and the position of a mouse to be calculated, therefore allowing for a more user-friendly user experience\n\t\t\t- ***What is an 'Output'?***\n\t\t\t\t- An output is a device/piece of hardware that gets the processed information, and displays them in some form to be accessible to an end-user. \n\t\t\t\t- *Examples of Output Devices:*\n\t\t\t\t\t- Monitor\n\t\t\t\t\t- Printer\n\t\t\t\t\t- Speakers\n\t\t\t\t\t- etc.\n\t\t\t\t- This is also a fundamental part of computers, as this provides feedback for the end user as to what they are doing. This is generally visual, although can appeal to other senses (such as through the use of Audio). \n\t\t\t- ***What is 'Processing'?***\n\t\t\t\t- Processing involves the manipulation of data to produce a different result. This can be as simple as counting up/down, or keeping the time, but through more complex calculations, can do things such as physics calculations.\n\t\t\t\t- **Components of 'Processing' (2)**:\n\t\t\t\t\t- CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Central Processing Unit*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is the main form of processing in most computers, and has a chip that has many tiny silicon transistors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Parts of a CPU:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Busses (3):**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Address Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This holds information for all the addresses (i.e. where all the data is located, especially for RAM)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Data Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This bus has access to all the data in a computer, and is able to read/write to hardware\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Control Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This bus controls all the other busses, and includes the Control Unit (CU), which generates instructions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Components (5 Units)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Control Unit (CU)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This controls all the data transfer and instructions for the CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Manages all the other units\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Gets instructions from memory, and directs the operation of the computer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Communicates with input/output devices to transfer data from storage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **DOES NOT** process or store data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Does the actual processing of data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Registers**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Memory Device (Information from the ALU goes to a Register)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **System Clock**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Keeps track of operations, and keeps operations in sync (the clock speed in a CPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Program Counter**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Counts the tasks being done (+1 per process), and notes what the next instructions are, and what data has been processed and schedules the next operation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Fetch Cycle (4)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Fetch Data**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Control Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Fetches data from memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Decode**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Control Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Translates information into machine code\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Process**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Arithmetic Logic Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Does the actual processing of information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Store**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Done by the Registers, and it stores information into Primary and Secondary Storage.\n\t\t\t\t\t- ***Memory***\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Primary Memory consists of '*Volatile*' memory (think about it as things that are generally flushed after shutting down a computer). As these are usually deleted very often, it doesn't hold any vital long term information, and generally holds temporary information (such as application details, and cache)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Examples of 'Primary Memory' are:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **RAM**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Random Access Memory*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Not directly connected to the CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Note that this is the only example of Primary Memory that is not directly connected to the CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is the most commonly recognisable form of primary memory, and is generally the largest capacity of Primary Memory in a system. This holds working information from the CPU (such as instructions), application details and cache\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Cache**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Directly connected to the CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This generally holds instructions for the CPU, especially if it is likely to reuse them. This is generally very small (in modern data standards), as it only holds information in hexadecimal or binary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Registers**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Directly connected to CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This holds information about the information (such as what address information is held), and other temporary information that is vital to CPU instructions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Advantages/Disadvantages of Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Very Quick**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is vital, as CPUs have gotten good enough where the Primary Memory is often a bottle-neck. Due to this, this memory has to be extremely quick in order to allow for the CPU to go to it's full potential. This also means that it is generally flash memory, as it is extremely quick, and also doesn't require any extra moving parts (and reducing points of failure is important for a CPU, which doesn't have any moving parts at all)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Very Small (in Capacity)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a downside of Primary Memory, as it is so expensive, it is difficult to get large amounts of it. It is also not designed to hold a lot of information, as it only needs to hold hexadecimal values or binary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Secondary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory consists of more '*Permanent*' memory (i.e. things that persist after shutting a computer down). This is what more important things are generally stored (such as documents, and user files), as otherwise they would be flushed every time someone were to shut down their computer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Examples of 'Secondary Memory' are:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **SSD**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Solid State Drive*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a storage device that uses '*flash-storage*' (i.e. something that holds electricity to represent a bit), and is generally very quick, and the downside of being more expensive per gigabyte. SSDs have no moving parts, and therefore are very reliable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **HDD**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Hard Drive Disk*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a storage device that uses physical 'platters', that are written into via a laser to produce bumps, which can then be read as a binary '0' or '1'. This allows for permanent storage, and is significantly cheaper than SSDs to manufacture, and have a higher gigabyte/dollar value, at the cost of being significantly slower than an SSD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Advantages/Disadvantages of Secondary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Needs an Extra Controller:**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory needs an extra controller to access (i.e. the CPU cannot directly access it). It needs something such as an *'NVMe'* Controller or *'SATA'* Controller to access.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Easier to package:**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- It is connected to the Motherboard, and therefore can be much more spread out (with things such as cables allowing for much freer designs and applications)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much cheaper than Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- It is significantly cheaper than Primary Memory to produce, and also has the option to be much larger than Primary Memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much slower than Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- As it isn't as vital for this memory to be quick, it is generally slower to have the potential of fitting in more information in for the money\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much more storage compared to Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory can hold much more memory compared to Primary Memory as it is designed to hold different forms of information such as documents, and the Operating System, which take up a lot of room.\n\n### Software:\n- ***What are the different types of software?***\n\t- **Operating System**\n\t\t- This is a piece of Software which is the main interface that a user will interface with, and also the main framework for applications to be run\n\t\t- **Types of Operating Systems**\n\t\t\t- **Desktop Operating Systems**\n\t\t\t\t- Standard consumer operating

I'm gonna try to work on the website somewhat frequently, but not excessively, so don't expect it to be amazingly good or something.\n\nAlso, there will be broken links and weird formatting, and things like that. I'm not that great of a coder, and also the majority of the notes  are old and thus are not formatted.\nW\nI will be making quite drastic changes to this website, e.g. style, formatting etc. in the coming weeks. I estimate that hopefully by **September**, the website should be running pretty smoothly.\n\nI am currently doing some *spring cleaning* of the website, so I will be going around and fixing all the broken links and stuff.\n\n\n### 25/08/2022\n\nHello! Couldn't wait a week to write another one of these. Just wanted to say that hopefully all images should be working right now, thanks to some epic javascript by Osacr, who is a member of the notes coalition. I will start begging Osacr to help with highlights, but in the mean time I probably won't be working on this project excessively. I'm not abandoning it though. Don't worry.\n\n\n### 27/08/2022\n\nSo it turns out that my formula for note taking isn't the slightest bit helpful because there aren't exactly clear links to stuff yet... Well I plan to fix this via republishing my Obsidian vault to Github (yes it was up in the first place), but I haven't gotten around to purging the vault of some personal stuff. \n\nNormally, this would be fine, but because people like Tag exist and Tag likes to take other people's notes without asking them, I've had to private the repository. Give me a few days and it'll be back soon. :)\n\n### 23/09/2022\n\nWe have moved to quartz!!! Yay! \n\nThe old website is now no longer worked on. It still exists. I can't be bothered to close it. Also the repo is now accessible. Might have to change a few things. Not sure though.\n\n\n### 30/09/2022\n\nAh it appears that Quartz automatically writes titles. Guess I gotta fix that. Also, I'm changing the formatting again :(\n\n[[secrets/How making a website erodes your mental stability]]\n\n### 6/11/2022\n\nI have moved to Linux!!!\n\nGive medal :)\n\nyea at this point im just testing\n\n### 2/12/2022\n\ntoday may be the day that obsidian works properly on linux\n\n### 20/12/2022\n\nLadies and gentlemen...\n\nI now present to you...\n\nThe [Linux Github Saga](Linux%20Github%20Saga.md)!!!\n\nAlso I've finally come around to working on this whole project. \n\nLike with some actual dedication.\n\n(not because christian blew my house up in minecraft)\n(again)\n\n### 23/02/2023\nFor the past two days, i may have accidentally slightly potentially deleted my website by pressing random buttons on github. Not my smartest moment.\n\nNot to fear, the website is back up, we have evolved into v.3!!!!\n\nAlongside upgrading, I will start using markdown links.\n\n### v.3\n*all rise for the ascension of obsidiannotes-v.3, reborn from the ashes of the past and its failures. hours of tinkering with makefiles, deploy.yaml and the likes, only to CHANGE A SINGLE BUTTON ON THE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM \"Read repository contents and packages permissions\" to \"Read and write permissions\" and it FINALLY WORKS. This is evidenced by the 15 failed commits before i finally got it to work.*\n\n*with the rise of a new obsidian notes version comes an announcement.The website shall be be reorganized into **~~the first Galactic Empire~~** a more efficient system using folders!!!! Please stand by as i find out how to make the whole folder sitch look less ugly :)*\n\n### 24/02/2023\n***BEHOLD!!!***\nThe website has been overhauled. All the links I could possibly fix have been fixed (please report any broken ones), and I have removed all the sussy folder files. In comes a new age of organisation(shocker)\n\n### 28/02/2023\n\nLinks are fixed\n\nI think this is the final evolution\n\n- I have made dark mode the default. It is a great day.\n- Assassinated the monkey\n\n### 4/03/2023\nI will attempt to fix recent notes. Wish me luck!\n\nanthony's bday gift has been executed\n\nwell damn i actually fixed it\n\njust had to execute some files w/o frontmatter\n\n### 15/03/2023\n\nI think its safe to say that the website is no longer in the developmental stage.\n\nThis is an amazing stage of evolution. Please clap.\n\nAnyways, this page will no longer be updated, and I will be moving to a [Notice Board](Notice%20Board.md).\n\nHere, you will find updates to the website, and the \"developmental\" stuff, but not actually development stuff, more like \"dev\" stuff but not actually dev stuff cause its not in development any more.\n\nIts just updates from now on (unless i delete my website(again(again)))\n\n",

  "/Differentiation-Notes": {
    "title": "Differentiation Notes",
    "content": "# Differentiation Notes\n\nEssentially, calculus is about finding the gradient of stuff. But, some equations don’t really have simple gradients like linear equations.\n\n\u003e $y=mx +c$ , where m is the gradient\n\nInstead, lets look at the equation $y = x^2$:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/Pasted image 20220422210133.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nLooking at points 0 to 1, the y values increase by 1 (1 – 0). However, from 1 to 2 it increases by 3 (4-1). This means we cannot use a simple number to describe the gradient of this function.\n\nNow, let’s look at the function where x = 1. We’re looking for the gradient of this point, and:\n\n$Gradient = \\frac{Rise}{Run}$\n\nBut to use that equation, we need 2 points.\n\nLet’s choose point (4,2).\n\nThe gradient using this point is: $\\frac{4-1}{2-1}$ = 3.\n\nThat’s good, but this point is really far away (relatively). If we’re looking for the gradient at a **particular point,** the closer we are to the point the better.\n\nWhat about (1.05, 1.1025)?\n\nThe gradient then becomes 2.05.\n\nThat’s very close to 2, but we can’t exactly infer right now. What about (1.001, 1.002001)?\n\nThe gradient is now 2.001.\n\nWell, it looks pretty clear that the gradient at 1 is 2.\n\nHow would we describe this using fancy words?\n\nLet’s say P is (1, 1), and Q is some point on this function.\n\nWe’d say that the **limit** of the gradient of the line (or chord) PQ (now we’re treating this line as a linear equation), as Q approaches P, appears to be 2.\n\nWe call this gradient the **instantaneous rate of change**. (instantaneous meaning within a certain instance, rate of change being another word for gradient)\n\nGreat, we’ve stated that the gradient of a certain point is two. But wait a second. How can a point have a gradient, if it’s a stationary point?\n\nWell, it can’t. But think of it like this.\n\nImagine we have a graph of a car’s distance travelled. The gradient of a point is essentially the velocity of this car. Velocity will increase when the distance function is steeper.\n\nBut, if we were to take a picture of the car in motion, then how could you tell that its moving?\n\nYou couldn’t with one image of the car, but with 2 at certain points, so you could compare the distance and time taken.\n\nThis makes it weird to think about velocity as a graph. If we were to isolate a single point on this graph of velocity, it wouldn’t make much sense because to compute velocity we need multiple points.\n\nNow, let’s think about the speedometer of the car as it travels. Perhaps the speedometer is measuring a small amount of time, analysing the difference in distance the car travels between 20 and 20.0001 seconds into its journey.\n\nTherefore, in the real world, this paradox of **instantaneous** rates of change is circumvented, by using a roughly similar approach that we used for the $y=x^2$ problem.\n\nThus, we should think of this rate of change not as **instantaneous,** but measuring a rate of change **over a _very_ small time**.\n\nNow, lets look at the $y=x^2$ problem again.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/nice triangle.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nLets say the black and blue lines represent a **really** small change in value. In this case, we'll let the length of the black lines = h (run), and we'll think about the blue lines later.\n\nWe'll say the bottom left point (indicated as 1,1) is actually x, just the x in $f(x)$, an x value on the x axis. That means the bottom right point is x + h.\n\nThe point at the very top of this triangle is $f(x+h)$, where $f(x)=x^2$. This is because $f(x)$ is the output when given x, the x value in this case is x + h.\n\nThe blue line would be equal to the value of the point at the top, minus the value of $f(x)$, or the point that we’re basing this off. i.e. The top right point minus the bottom left point. This makes the **rise** of the gradient $f(x+h) - f(x)$. (the difference between the 2 points)\n\nNow, the gradient formula is $\\frac{Rise}{Run}$. Remember the run is the black line, which is essentially h. Therefore, The gradient of these points that we’re chosen is:\n\n$\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$\n\nRemember that h is just some arbitrary value that we're adding to a point (variable) to create 2 points.\n\nNow, we’ve said before that as the distance between these two points (on the x axis), we get closer to the gradient of the point.\n\nLikewise, we describe this as a **limit**, where something approaches zero (in this case), which would be the distance between the two points.\n\nNow, we can write the formula as:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$\n\nDoes this work with our function, $f(x)=x^2$?\n\nLet’s substitute our function into this formula.\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x^2+2hx+h^2-x^2}{h}$\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2hx+h^2}{h}$\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} 2x+h$\n\nNow, at this point you may realise something from chapter 3 of Sadler 1. If h is approaching 0, doesn’t that mean we can’t divide it?\n\nWell, yes but that’s exactly why we use limits in the first place! It essentially allows us to choose when to actually acknowledge that h = 0.\n\nJust kidding. Remember, we’re still looking for the rate of change **over a small time**. h may approach 0, but by definition of limits (dont search that up), It’s not exactly 0 until we need it to.\n\nSo, since $h \\to 0$, $(2x+h) \\to 2x$, where h becomes 0.\n\nThus, instead of keeping the h part, we just state the gradient without the h.\n\nKnowing that the “gradient” of the graph $y=x^2$ is $2x$, does this follow what we’ve found out before?\n\nWell, what about the point (1,1)? Well, the x in the gradient equation is equal to the x in the function (and the point), so:\n\nAt the point (1,1),\n\nGradient $= 2 \\times 1$\n\t\t\t\t  $= 2$\n\nJust as we’ve found before!",

    "content": "\n## Living Standards\n\n- The living standard of a population is **measured** in two ways: **material living standards and non-material living standards.**\n- Material Standards **measures quality and quantity of goods and services** for each person in an economy\n\t- We have to consider the **availability** of goods and services (are they accessible?)\n\t- Measured by **real GDP**. *GDP measures the stuff we've got.*\n\t- Material living standards refer to our access to physical goods and services.\n\t- The car we drive, the house we live in and the food we eat are all examples of physical possessions that contribute to our material living standards.\n\t- The material living standards of a nation are usually accessed or measured by the quantity of goods and services available each year as measured by , for example, GDP.\n\t- Many would agree that if the citizens of a country have access to more goods and services to satisfy their needs and wants, life is generally better.\n\t- Moreover, producing goods and services provides citizens with employment, and therefore an income to buy goods and services that improve their lives.\n- Non-material Standards measure **intangibles**, focusing on **quality of life**\n\t- The dimensions measured are usually life expectancy, literacy, rate, leisure hours, etc.\n\t- Non-material living standards must also be considered when assessing the quality of life.\n\t- Non-material living standards cannot be measured in dollar terms, and are intangible, but affect our enjoyment of life.\n\t- Non-material living standards are **hard to measure**.\n\t\t- We have some indicators, however, such as the OECD Better Life Index.\n\n### Examples of Material standards of living\n- Income\n- Housing\n- Access to amenities\n\t- Public transport\n\t- Water\n\t- Electricity\n\n### Examples of Non-material standards of living\n- Environment\n- Leisure time\n- Work life balance\n- Political freedoms\n\n#### More factors:\n- **Freedom of speech** - such as being able to peacefully protest against the government of the day\n- **Free elections** - that provide the right to choose and dismiss parliamentary representatives\n- **Low levels of crime and discrimination** - where citizens can live without fear of constant crime or being treated differently because off actors such as race, disability or age.\n- ***Preservation of the environment*** - allowing citizens to enjoy nature, breathe clean air and drink clean water\n- **Adequate leisure time** - so that employment have adequate rest periods away from work and time to spend with family\n\n### Effect of living standards in the real world:\n- China has focused primarily on the material standard of living when progressing their economy.\n\n### Important questions about living standards:\n- What happens when basic living standards are not met?\n- What are basic needs that would ensure an acceptable standard of living for an individual in society?\n- What are some benchmarks that allow us to ascertain if living standards are met\n- Are material needs more important than non-material needs?\n\n- **How has Australia fared over the years?**\n\n## Poverty\n- Poverty can be defined as the state in which an individual or household is not able to fulfil minimum consumption needs.\n- It is not always about money, but it also entails access to basic facilities such as proper hygiene, sanitation, food, shelter, drinking water, health, education, transport, whose absence as a whole, is regarded as poverty.\n- It can be absolute poverty or relative poverty. Absolute poverty is when there is an absence of a minimum level of subsistence needed for the basic well being.\n\n### Absolute poverty\n- Cannot meet the basic necessities of life\n\t- Sanitation, medical care, education, food\n- We compare the income of a household with the standard minimum income of the household within an economy.\n- This standard is different depending on the country.\n\n### Relative poverty\n- Someone who lacks the least amount of income required to maintain the normal standard of living, in the society to which they belong.\n\t- For example they may not have access to housing\n- They are **relatively poor** compared to other members of society.\n- The word relative means in comparison to, so we define poverty concern the **overall distribution of income** to another person/family/country.\n- We either compare members of a country, or we compare **countries with countries**.\n\n### Housing\n- Housing is fundamental to all Australians and our housing market has a significant influence on a number of key social and economic aspects of society.\n- It plays a major role in the health and wellbeing of Australians, by providing shelter, safety, security and privacy.\n- The availability of affordable, sustainable and appropriate housing enables people to participate in the social, economic and community aspects of their lives.\n- From a social perspective, housing provides a stable base from which we can participate in society, form families, and enjoy retirement. Housing can determine lifetime education, employment and health outcomes.\n- From an economic perspective, housing has a significant impact upon investment, productivity and participation, as well as consumption and saving trends across the economy.\n#### Housing security\n- What happens when our society cannot maintain affordable housing?\n- A lot of bad consequences.\n- The absence of affordable, secure and appropriate housing can result in homelessness, poor health and lower rates of employment and education.\n\n#### Homelessness\n- People experiencing homelessness include those who sleep rough on the streets or under **makeshift** dwellings.\n- Although people who sleep rough are most visible to the public, they only represent 7% of homelessness in Australia.\n- Homelessness can also include individuals and families moving between temporary shelters, including housing of friends, family and emergency acommodation.\n- The legal definition is different for every country.\n- People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing due to an unsteady or lack of income.\n- Homelessness and **poverty** are **interrelated**.\n\t- *It is difficult to get a job, if you lack a stable environment to apply for jobs.*\n- In general, there is no methodological consent on counting the homeless and identifying their special needs, thus in most cities only estimated homeless populations are know.\n\n### The poverty line\n- Poverty line is often discussed in relation to poverty, which means an estimated minimum household income threshold, which is required to fulfil the basic necessities of life.\n- Any person or family below this threshold is identified as poor.\n\n### What is income:\n- Income is money that an individual or business receives, usually from exchanging by providing a good or service through investing capital.\n- Investments, pensions, and forms of welfare payment are primary sources of income for retirees.\n- For individuals, income is most often received in the form of wages or salary.\n- Business income can refer to a company's remaining revenues after paying all expenses and taxes. In this case, income is referred to as \"earnings\". Most forms of income are subject to taxation\n\nWhat affects income?\n- Personal incomes:\n\t- Economic/social/political conditions\n\t- Education\n\t- Experience\n\t- etc.\n- Business incomes:\n\t- Economic climate\n\t- Factors of Production cost?\n\n## Lesson Tasks:\n- Look at different types of housing in Australia, and find how much is available (private, rental, public)\n\n\n",

Neon's electronic configuration (using spdf notation) is:\n\t* $1s^22s^22p^6$\n* Here, the last subshell is a p subshell. Thus, Argon is a **p-block element**.\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/Pasted image 20220412202739.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\n**Recall:** Aufbau's principle!!!! There is not a linear direction to the spdf blocks. \n\nThis is because, **certain subshells dont have (sorta) consistent levels of energy.**\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/AufbauPrinciple.png\"\u003e\n\nE.g. Titanium: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}4s^{2}3d^{2}$\n\nHere, the **4s** subshell has a lower energy than the **3d** subshell, thus we write it first.\n\n**Isoelectronic species** - chemical species that have the same number of electrons/ same electronic structure/ same electronic configuration\n\n* In general, this applies when atoms have the same electron configuration, but varying atomic mass (e.g. S-2 and Ar)\n\n**Absorption and Emissions Spectrum:**\n* Bohr's model describes the existence of **absorption/emissions spectra**.\n\t* *From the idea that electrons occupy energy levels, and can be excited to higher energy levels\n* An absorption spectrum represents **different wavelengths of photons being absorbed**.\n\t* In comparison, an emissions spectrum represents **wavelengths of photons being emitted**\n* The lines we see in absorption/emission spectrums are called **spectra**.\n* This occurs as electrons absorb energy to be excited to higher energy levels.\n\t* *Note: A spectrum of light is not the only way for electrons to be excited. They can be excited through **heat** or **electrical discharge**\n* Here, electrons only choose photons with a specific frequency to excite them, and when they drop back to the ground state, they release photons.\n\t* Note that all energy levels of an atom have **specific, discrete** energy quantities. \n* Here, the energy of the photons is equal to: **the difference between the two energy levels** that an electron falls from.\n* This means multiple photons can be produces from a single electron being excited.\n\t* e.g. Lets say that an electron is excited from the ground state to n = 3.

    "content": "\nAn ocean of anger had consumed the once quiet town of San Latzio. Two distinctively radical schools of thought had entrenched themselves deep within the community, creating a sharp division between the beliefs of the townsfolk. On one hand, a devoutly religious congregation, and on the other, a purely scientific, technologically driven perspective. An unquestionably prominent tension had risen, with both sides prepared to set the town ablaze in a firestorm of fury.\n\nLeaning on a pole opposite a dimly lit door, Reverend Lorenzo spotted the slender man slowly approaching under the veil of the night sky. The pitch black surrounding the man quickly parted ways, revealing a plain white coat and an eccentric, recalcitrant hairstyle.\n\n“Ah, Reverend. What a beautifully clear night sky! How fascinating that the clouds have cleared.\"\n\n“Indeed, perhaps we have God to thank for such calming, tranquil weather”\"\n\n\"Perhaps you should put your faith in something more realistic, more grounded, and more logical”\n\n\"Now, save your argument for another time. Past this door is a wine bottle with your name on it.\"\n\nThe two entered through the door, revealing an isolated pub. Pushing past the door, a bell rang. Sitting down near the front of the bar, the scientist pulled out of his coat an artificial hand made of pig fat and straw, out of place among the earthy wood flooring and crimson flames of candles. He signalled the bartender, carefully projecting his voice to order two glasses of the tavern’s finest wine.\n\n\"What do you think of this place?\" The Reverend inquired.\n\n“I’ve only heard good things about the wine here. I suspect they use a more refined methodology of wine extraction, alongside fresher grapes.”\n\n\"My my, no need to overthink such things. I’m confident it's due to the expertise of the vintner.\"\n\nThe inventor’s eye twitched. With a strained voice, the inventor asked, \"Well then, to what do I owe the pleasure of meeting you today?\"\n\n\"I feel the church is getting rather archaic in the coming years. Just last week, a tile came down and nearly sent me on an early trip to Heaven.\"\n\nThe inventor twitched again. He started tapping erratically on the table.\n\n\"Interesting. Any ideas for what I could do to assist you, Reverend?\"\n\n“Well, I was thinking you could provide some insights. As a man of God, I feel woefully unspecialised in terms of creativity. I am a preacher, not a thinker.\"\n\nThe tapping stopped. \"Oh,\" The inventor inquired in a surprised, partially elated voice, “in that case, I have many suggestions on how to improve the quality and prestige of your church. Have you considered a religious newspaper? All you would need to do is write your sermons, and they could be delivered without a word said.\"\n\nThe Reverend took a large sip from his glass. \"Preaches are not simply words strung together. There is a wholly human feeling conveyed when I preach in front of an audience. I assure you, it will take technology a thousand years before they can replace the sense of connection you feel when you go to mass.\"\n\nThe inventor frowned. \"There is no such thing as this ‘human connection’ you’re talking about, Reverend. A printing press could easily do your job in a fraction of the time and effort.\"\n\nA sharp red flame smouldered in the Reverend’s eyes, only to be extinguished abruptly.\n\n\"Now now, we’re going off-topic, my friend. In the meantime, we can ponder over your religious paper another day.”\n\n“Perhaps I could set up a clinic and cure the ailments of your patrons.”\n\nWhat is there to cure? God’s work done in God’s way will never lack God’s supplies. The Lord has a plan for all of his children. To artificially cure one of their diseases is to go against the will of God. \"\n\n\"Well, does God have no heart?\" The inventor violently snapped. Does he have no empathy, no compassion, no soul? How could he condemn children to death? \"\n\n\"I’ve had enough of your bickering!\" The Reverend snapped back. He had risen from his seat, a rare instance of anger resonating from the benign Reverend.\n\n“You need this job as much as I do,” The Reverend softly spoke. “Let’s calm down. Surely you have other ideas. \"\n\nAn atmosphere of outrage emanated from the inventor. All of his body was tense, as if he was preparing for a fight.\n\nGradually, the rage subsided into disappointment. A sense of defeat rushed over the inventor. He was one of the greatest minds of San Latzio, yet he was burdened with serving another as a consequence of his lack of fame and funding.\n\nYou’re right, Reverend. It was very illogical of me to speak in such an uncontrolled manner. Truth be told, my late father was a Christian, and the thing he wanted most out of a church, as a rather educated worshipper, was his own copy of the Bible. Perhaps, if you’d so graciously let me, I could distribute paper versions of the Bible, so followers could read along with you. \"\n\nThe Reverend pondered for a bit. \"Interesting,\" he responded, \"It's brilliant! Giving everyone a bible will bring them close to God. I’ll fund your printing press as soon as you can start working on it. \"\n\n\"Great! \"I'll start working on it tomorrow, and I'll keep you updated as I go,\" the inventor said excitedly, \"It's been a pleasure working with you, Reverend.\"\n\nLikewise, my friend, I hope we meet again.\n\nThe Reverend’s use of a printing press was a resounding success for San Latzio’s small community church, bringing international recognition and making the Reverend an icon of Christianity. His following would grow tenfold, allowing him to fulfil his dream of preaching to the largest possible audience.\n\nThe inventor’s brilliant invention of the printing press brought him renown among his fellow inventors, securing him an invitation to the finest, intellectual parts of society. Forever named in the history books, he would go on to revolutionise society with his many inventions.\n\n#10ENG ",

On one hand, a devoutly religious congregation, and on the other, a purely scientific, technologically driven perspective. An unquestionably prominent tension had risen, with both sides prepared to set the town ablaze in a firestorm of fury.\n\nThe Reverend sat at the front table of a local pub. It was well known for its exquisite vintage wine as San Latzio's gold standard, alongside being notoriously hard to find. \n\nPerhaps his acquaintance had lost themselves while looking for the dimly lit alleyway the bar discretely resided in. \n\nJust as the Reverend prepared to leave, a figure emerged from the pub's door. The candle-lit flames of the bar illuminated a plain white coat, and an eccentric, recalcitrant hairstyle. He was an amateur inventor, seeking fame in a world overcome by greed. \n\n\"Ah, Reverend! Forgive me for my lack of punctuality, I managed to enter the wrong pub!\"\n\n\"Not to worry, my friend. Please, have a seat.\" The Reverend gestured to the empty seat opposite to his.\n\nAs the Inventor took a seat, the Reverend signalled the bartender. \"Two glasses of your finest wine, please.\" \n\nThe Inventor looked in shock. \"Reverend, you overestimate my financial status. I simply cannot afford such quality wine.\" \n\"Luckily for you, my friend, I'll be paying for your drinks tonight. It's the least I can do to return your gratitude. I'm sure you could've spent this time on much more pressing matters.\"\n\nThe Inventor smiled. He wasn't expecting such a kind, generous demeanour from a devout Christian. \n\nGrowing up in a heavily conservative family meant dealing with religion was difficult. His father's numerous lectures on a youthful Inventor's lack of piety pushed him into the sciences, and away from the embrace of God.\n\n\"Well then, Reverend. To what do I owe the pleasure of discussing with you today?\"\n\n\"The church is getting very rundown as of recent years. Just last week, a loose ceiling tile nearly sent me to God!\" The Reverend joked.\n\nThe Inventor let out a heavy sigh. This was the religious zealot he had come accustomed to as a citizen of San Latzio. One that could not go more than two sentences without mentioning God.\n\n\"Interesting. Any ideas for what I could do to assist you, Reverend?\"\n\n\"Sadly, as a man of God, I lack the creativity to produce ideas. I am a preacher, not a thinker like you.\" \n\n\"Fascinating,\" the Inventor replied in a surprised, partially elated voice, \"in that case, I have many suggestions on how to improve the quality and prestige of the church. Have you considered a medicinal clinic? Evidence shows an increase in ailments uncured due to religion.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" The Reverend exclaimed in a burst of impulse. \"The Lord has a plan for all of his children. To artificially cure is to go against the will of God.\"\n\n\"Well then, does God have no heart?\" The Inventor violently snapped. \"How could he condemn children to death?\"\n\nA deathly silence engulfed the table. Both men were standing up from their chair, anger consuming their rationality. \n\nA sharp red flame smouldered in the Reverend's eyes, only to be extinguished by the sight of a familiar face. \n\nA middle-aged man walked through the pub's door. A dirty white smock spreading dirt and vegetation on the bar's floor, it was as if he had just arrived from a farm. \n\n\"Reverend! Fancy seeing you here!\" The man spoke as his lifted his brown hat from his head. \n\n\"Ah, James. I have the honour to meet you once again.\"\n\nThe Reverend paused. He did not know how to introduce the Inventor, he knew all too well James' opinion on science.\n\n\"You look familiar. Where have I seen your face before?\" James inquired.\n\n\"He's a deacon at a neighbouring church. We've been discussing his duties.\" The Reverend responded.\n\n\"Hold on. Aren't you that sacrilegious heretic that goes against the will of God? What do you call yourself, an 'inventor'?\"\n\n\"How dare you!\" The Inventor exclaimed. \"Just because I don't buy all this illogical, made-up nonsense about religious, does not mean you can insult my title.\"\n\n\"Some title. You take pride in being an arrogant fool, grasping at wheat straws when God has the answer.\"\n\n\"Who is the true fool, someone who investigates and analyses for their truth or one who takes 'truth' from the mouths of liars?\"\n\n\"My God! How dare you insult the Lord!\" James shouted, as he grabbed the Inventor's glass of wine and held it up towards the Inventor's head.\n\n\"That's enough!\" The Reverend shouted. Both men recoiled in shock, as they had never seen such a pious man release so much anger. James dropped the glass, causing it to shatter into a thousand fragments.\n\nA subtle peace filled the almost desolate pub. \n\n\"My friend,\" the Reverend spoke, breaking the silence, \"would God appreciate you harassing another one of God's children?\"\n\n\"And you,\" the Reverend turned to the Inventor, \"is it rational and logical to argue over topics such as religion?\"\n\n\"Now, James, please pay the bartender for their troubles in replacing the glass.\"\n\nWithout word, James drifted towards the bartender, softly apologising. \n\n\"Thank you, Reverend.\" The Inventor finally spoke. He had never felt such respect for a man of religion before. \n\n\"I have an idea, for your church.\"\n\n\"Brilliant, I'll get your funding to you as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe two would meet frequently after their first encounter. Working together, they would improve the Reverend's church while earning the Inventor the fame he desired.\n\nThe idea of science working alongside religion spread, bringing peace and prosperity at last to San Latzio.\n\n\n\n#10ENG ",

Its antique, wooden aesthetic propagated an inviting atmosphere, drawing Claudia further towards the entrance.\n\nInside, she saw a majestic, luminous fireplace gently warming the isolated, yet vibrant inside. She peered across a visibly worn-out counter, to see an almost empty array of tables, excluding the odd customer. At table *tre*, Claudia spotted her long time friend. It had been years since they had first met eyes, yet from the day that she saw his dishevelled hair, his sharp, but loving eyes, and his warm, caring gestures, she instantly knew of the loving character hidden within his solitary attitude.\n\n\"Welcome to Italy.\" He eloquently articulated as Claudia approached the table. She blushed gently, nervously grasping at the handles of her plastic bag. She knew that as a fisherman, her long-time friend would disapprove of her use of plastic. Furthermore, she had just been shopping nearby, when she was told to enter the café. Graciously, she sat down and searched through her bag, avoiding the spikes of a fresh pineapple and pulling out an ultramarine blue bottle of wine. \"Here, so we don't have to purchase some drinks.\" \"Amazing, this brand is the best.

    "content": "\nQuestion: Discuss how particular values and attitudes are **promoted** within at least one studied text to **challenge** an audience.\n\nIndividuals in society reflect their own concerns over the direction their community takes. This is most prominent in the literature and artistic works of turbulent time-periods. The short story 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. Similarly, 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury in set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, the 21st and 20th century respectively, both convey a sceptical attitude towards technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of family, culture and human connection, alongside a critical, sceptical attitude towards technology and challenge the progressive attitudes of readers that are passionate about technology.\n\nBy presenting an expressive dialogue context of a silent community, both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a strong value of human connection in society and challenge their audience’s pessimism towards in-person communication. In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Rong girl Quy's second uncle and the Galactic man Galen Santos where both speech and appearance has been modified by the use of immersers, when Second Uncle \"rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction.\" This characterisation of Second Uncle as a financially driven person who uses technology at a cost of his connection to his Rong culture alienates minor ethnic groups within society, such as the Rong. In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s inspired attitude towards technology, by presenting a technological society where humanity is marginalised. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a quiet street, asking the dimly lit houses \"What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue? A comedian falling off the stage?\" Leonard Mead's one-sided dialogue and repetition highlights his isolation in the largely populated city he lives in. This depressing atmosphere further promotes the importance of human connection in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. In contrast, the audience’s value of technology as an indicator of scientific development and their disregard towards traditional values of human connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the dehumanising impacts of technology. Thus, using a subtle dialogue and imagery enhanced by the lack of a response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, challenging the audience's more progressive views on family values.\n\nBoth 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a concerned attitude towards society's disregard for individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is highlighted as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the silent streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's emphasis of the streets completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes strip individuals of their individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how \"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust, because so much of you draws attention to itself—the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\". Through the use of this representation of a marginalised population changing to appear like a more prominent race, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's ostracism of unique cultures and individuals. Thus, by utilising characterisation via internal monologues, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding society's cynical attitudes towards individuality.\n\nFurthermore, both texts promote a critical attitude towards technology and its effect on individuality, challenging the expected values of their science-fiction audience. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of an internal dialogue further promotes a sceptical attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture and homogenise society. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", how \"there was no one in the front seat\", and how the car \"hesitated, or rather gave a faint whirring click\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. This works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to imitate humans, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote to their audiences a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own positive attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote a value of human connection, and promote an antagonising attitude towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's degrading attitudes towards individuality. This works to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their progressive and endearing attitude towards technology, and a sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience. Both authors utilise their texts to promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society.\n\n# Quotes\n\n**The Pedestrian**\n\n1. **Human connection/family/cultural values**\n\t1. \"he was alone in this world of A.D. 2053, or as good as alone,\"\n\t2. \"it was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\"\n\t3. \"Sudden gray phantoms seemed to manifest upon inner room walls... there were whisperings and murmurs where a window in a tomb-like building was still open.\"\n\t4. \"an entire street [would] be startled by the passing of a lone figure,\"\n\t5. \"The street was silent and long and empty,\"\n\t6. \"In ten years of walking... he had never met another person walking,\"\n\t7. \n2. **Society's attitudes towards individuality**\n\t1. \"he was alone in this world of A.D. 2053, or as good as alone,\"\n3. **Critical attitude towards technology and its effects on individuality.**\n\t1. \"this one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets.\"\n\n**Immersion**\n\n1. **Human connection/family/cultural values**\n\t1. \n2. **Society's attitudes towards individuality**\n\t1. \n3. **Critical attitude towards technology and its effects on individuality.**\n\t1. \n",

This can be seen in 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard and 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury, two science fiction short stories that challenge the ways their technologically inclined audiences view their interaction with technology. 'Immersion' is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. On the other hand, 'The Pedestrian' is set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, audiences from both time periods hold a strong interest in technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of culture and human connection, alongside a critical attitude towards dominant ethnicities neglecting the development of individuality in their society.

Thus, using a subtle dialogue and imagery enhanced by the lack of a response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, challenging the audience's more apathetic views on family values.\n\n'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' both promote a worried attitude regarding society's disdain for distinctiveness, while challenging their audiences' own beliefs on individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is portrayed as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the empty streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's use of a simile to present the streets as completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. In doing so, Bradbury details a society of conformity, demonstrating to audiences a society opposed to individuality. This challenges Bradbury's audience's apathy towards society's ignorance of individuality, describing their focus on technological progress as detrimental to societal well-being. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes harms individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how ==\"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust... the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\". (shorten this)== Through the use of imagery, de Bodard presents ethnic Rong people as inhuman and outcasted from the text's society. In doing so, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's ostracism of unique cultures and individuals. Thus, by utilising characterisation via internal monologues, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding modern society's desire for homogeneity ==(and conformity?)==.\n\nFurthermore, both texts advocate a critical approach towards technology and its impact on individuality, challenging their science-fiction audience's endearing values of technology. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of a nihilistic, cynical presents a sombre attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture and homogenise society. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", and how \"there was no one in the front seat\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. The artificial lack of humanity works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to imitate humans, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote  a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own optimistic attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote the value of human connection, and antagonising attitudes towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's apathetic attitudes towards individuality, to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their optimistic, endearing attitude towards technology, and sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience and promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society. In this way, texts are able to confront their audiences and critique relevant issues with societal progress.\n\n**Biblography(Harvard Referencing System):**\n- Bradbury, R., 1951. _The Pedestrian_.

    "content": "\nQuestion (4): Discuss how particular values and attitudes are promoted within at least one studied text to challenge an audience.\n\nIndividuals in society reflect their own concerns over the trajectory of their culture in the literature and artistic works of their time. This can be seen in 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard and 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury, two science fiction short stories that challenge the ways their technologically inclined audiences view their interaction with technology. 'Immersion' is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. On the other hand, 'The Pedestrian' is set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, audiences from both time periods hold a strong interest in technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of culture and human connection, alongside a critical attitude towards dominant groups' imposition of conformity in their society. A sceptical attitude towards technology is also advocated, with both texts challenging the progressive and often optimistic attitudes of Western science fiction readers.\n\nBy presenting unique characterisations that contrast their dull environment, both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote the importance of human connection in society and confront their audience's aversion to personal interaction. In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Second Uncle and Galactic Galen Santos, when Second Uncle \"rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction.\" This characterisation of Second Uncle as a financially driven person who sacrifices his connection to his Rong culture for smoother interactions with his Galactic customers portrays him as immoral in his willingness to discard his cultural norms and values. This emphasises the importance of valuing authentic human connection by presenting an artificially perfect dialogue as lacking vital human qualities such as distinct cultural communication styles. In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s indifference towards the necessity for human connection within society. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a silent street, asking the houses \"What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue?\" Through his repetition of rhetorical questions and flamboyant actions, Leonard Mead's characterisation as being isolated from society promotes the importance of personal communication in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. In contrast, the audience’s disregard towards traditional values of social connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the bleakness of societies where communication is subtly distorted beyond recognition or non-existent between citizens. Thus, by utilising characterisation, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, condemning their audience's more apathetic views on social interaction.\n\n'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' both promote a disapproving attitude regarding a dominant attitude towards a conformist society, while challenging their audiences' own unconcerned beliefs on individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is portrayed as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the empty streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's use of a simile to present the streets as completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. In doing so, Bradbury details a society of conformity, constructing to audiences a censorious attitude towards society's predominantly conformist beliefs. This challenges Bradbury's audience's indifferent attitude towards society's ignorance to individuality, portraying their lack of compassion regarding conformity as damaging to societal well-being. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes harms individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how \"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust... the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\".  Through the use of imagery, de Bodard presents ethnic Rong people as inferior and imperfect in the context of their own society. In doing so, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's favouring of specific cultures and the hypercritical effect of conformity on the psyches of minor ethnicities. Thus, by utilising characterisation via imagery, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding modern society's desire for homogeneity and mindless conformity.\n\nFurthermore, both texts advocate a critical attitude towards technology's impact on individuality, challenging their science-fiction audience's endearing values of technology. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of a cynical tone presents a dismal attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture, challenging their Western audience's affectionate attitude towards technology by highlighting its disturbing ability to manipulate individuality. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", and how \"there was no one in the front seat\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. The artificial lack of humanity works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to deconstruct and manipulate individuality, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own optimistic attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote the value of human connection, and antagonising attitudes towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's apathetic attitudes towards individuality, to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their optimistic, endearing attitude towards technology, and sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience and promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society. In this way, texts are able to confront their audiences and critique relevant issues with societal progress.\n\n**Biblography(Harvard Referencing System):**\n- Bradbury, R., 1951. _The Pedestrian_.

    "content": "\n**People involved:**\n\n* Host \n* Guest speaker\n\n(Recording of Peter Dutton's statement on (immigrants) plays)\n\n(Insert transcript here)\n\n**Host:** Now, we are extremely grateful to have guest speaker Hải Minh Nguyễn. Being considered a 'boat person' himself, his bestseller \"A soulless ocean\" has brought to light the struggles that countless families bravely fought for a chance at a new life in Australia. Hải Minh, what do you think about Dutton's recent zero-tolerance policy of boat refugees?\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's frankly outrageous. I find it difficult to believe that Australia, one of the strongest democracies in the free world, could implement such an unsympathetic, authoritarian border policy. I can still remember the journey I embarked on as my family left Vietnam. My family had owned a prosperous farm near Saigon, and had a comfortable life. However, when the North seized Saigon, they took everything away from us. The farm was confiscated by the state, and we had to share all of our hard-earned wealth and belongings with Northern soldiers, who treated us like slaves.\n\n**Host:** That sounds horrible. Please continue.\n\n**Hải Minh:** Well, my family saw no other option but to leave. There was no freedom for us in Vietnam, and we had a target on our back for supporting the South in the war. So we gathered as many valuables as we could find, and my father paid for our extended family to leave for Australia. I was only 10, so I can barely recall life in Vietnam, but I definitely can remember the journey. I shouldn't call it a journey, as it was more of a punishment. A punishment for leaving Vietnam, for leaving people behind. Any family I have left there are either dead or their whereabouts are unknown. The voyage was heartless, with the waves thundering like the artillery shells back at home. It was as if I had never left. I was still hurdled in a corner, desperately grabbing the floor in the hopes a big wave wouldn't send me overboard. The suffocating winds of salt was overcome by the smell of vomit. This was a struggle that everyone onboard endured, for months on end. Not everyone made it through. My grandmother would pass away a few kilometres from the shores of Australia.\n\n**Host:** I'm deeply sorry for your loss.\n\n**Hải Minh:** She was one of the lucky ones. She was buried in Australia. Those that died before here would be thrown into the sea. Their grave being the vast waterbed of the Pacific. Our family went through all this pain, suffering and torture, just to make it to Australia. To have a new life, one of personal and economic liberty. For them, the risk of dying a thousand kilometres away from home among the waves was worth it. \n\n**Host:** And now Dutton's new policy has taken away this opportunity for anyone else.\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's even worse than that. Dutton's so-called Operation Sovereign Borders completely fails to inform potential refugees that they will be denied. So all it does is send boats back. Without any sort of support, or protection. Sure, your family may have perished and you are unable to enter your home country without death looming, but the Australian government will still deny you access to the fabled land of freedom just a few meters away. There is no sense of morality in Dutton's policy. There is only arrogance, and insensitivity to the plight of refugees. \n\n**Host:** How would you say this policy affects Australia's image worldwide.\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's worrying, to be sure. When a first-world, free nation starts denying people with nowhere to go, one might question the humanitarian intent of the Australian government. Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, so it's rather concerning when 47 member states called out the Australian Government's refugee policies, pointing out a non-robust and discriminatory approach to refugee arriving by boat. \n\n**Host:** Do you think the UN has the right to condemn or enforce a more lenient refugee policy in Australia?\n\n**Hải Minh:** Absolutely. Australia chose to ratify the Refugee Convention. They should understand and adhere to its clear, well-defined points. The lives of refugees should not be a political hammer for the ruling party to beat the opposite with.\n\n**Host:** Agreed, these are families we're talking about. Families with nothing left anymore, who have no choice but to become refugees in the hopes of a better life. Now, take a look at this picture.\n\n(Picture of refugees show)\n\n![[Pasted image 20220331135611.png]]\n\n**Host:** What do you think of this?\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's an unfortunate reality we live in. None of these people want to be refugees. They just want to survive, and have the best opportunity at life. When we send back boats, we are denying refugees their basic human rights to freedom of movement. I am fortunate to have had many great moments in my life. But none were as joyous or rewarding when I got off the boat. Having made it through the thundering hell that is the Pacific, I could really appreciate the tranquillity and silence of Australia. The calm tides washing over my feet, it was as if I was reborn. My family had nothing to their name, so we had to work hard to survive. But we did. We did so with a smile on our face, because we knew the alternative was a cold, bitter life as workers under Vietnam's tyrannical government. \n\n**Host:** So arriving at the shores of Australia liberated you from your loyalty to Vietnam.\n\n**Hải Minh:** Exactly. At that moment, I became an Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# References",

    "content": "\nSustainability is not simply an ideology one can take, but a necessary sacrifice we must make as a species for our own self-preservation.\n\nPerhaps you envision a climate change activist as a childish university student who shouts back the eco-friendly rhetoric they've heard online. \n\nBut believing in sustainability and ecopolitics does not make you an irrational, radical person.\n\nIn Germany, the Green party has risen to prominence as one of the largest parties in German democracy, even polling as the most popular for a brief amount of time.\n\nThis means that environmentalism is not a fringe, radical ideology. It has gone mainstream in a prestigious, well-developed country such as Germany, proving its value within our societies. \n\nGreen politics is no longer a heavily progressive, extremist following, but a unifying political affiliation. Built on the simple idea that we must do better for the future, it has attracted a wide, diverse voting base. It promotes a cultural unification and globalism. As a result, both young and old find themselves supporters of the German Green Party.\n\nFurthermore, it is no longer a respectable, logical stance to stand defiant against the wave of green support, and claim the facts are fraudulent. \n\nSome of the most esteemed and advanced scientific organisations have all come forward to acknowledge the existence of climate change, such as NASA, The Royal Society, Harvard, the United Nations, etc.\n\nIn a modern society, when one has access to the world's vast collective storage of information, it is unacceptable to deny climate change's existence when the evidence is everywhere.\n\nPerhaps you think that it's just a few degrees of change. That it'll only get a little hotter and a little colder.\n\nLet's say that the temperature changes by about 2 degrees. That's not much, right? If it were a normal day, then it would only be a little hotter, reminiscent of summer. \n\nIt very well could be, for you at least. As investigated by numerous scientific journals and research papers, we can expect a variance in temperature by 2 degrees to cause up to 1.5 months of heat waves. Furthermore, it would cause a 98% chance for an increase in coral bleaching, and a 16% reduction in wheat production, among other things.\n\nOnce again, perhaps you think that might not affect you. However, a 16% reduction in wheat means a lot for developing countries, where food is scarce. Imagine that there are a hundred people in a town, that are fed by 100 loaves of bread a day. If 16% of wheat production stop completely, then 16 loaves of bread wouldn't be produced.\n\nThus, 16 people go hungry.\n\nThey aren't the only ones who are impacted by this.\n\nSimply put, supply and demand means that low supply will increase prices. You could as far away from the physical effects of climate change as you like, but if 16% of the world's food supply disappears, then your wallet will suffer the increased price of basic foods.\n\nRecently, Australia went through a food supply crisis, when shortages, when the food supply chain broke down as a result of the pandemic.\n\nAlthough it wasn't caused by climate change, food supply shortages can even affect first world nations such as Australia.\n\nNow, perhaps you attribute green politics to socialism, and wholeheartedly believe that it goes against your conservative political views.\n\nI personally disagree, as I believe that environmentalism can be one of the most traditional ideologies out there.\n\nThe whole goal of ecopolitics is to **conserve** the natural world around us. \n\nTo ensure that the next generation and their children can enjoy the same world that we currently reside in. \n\nA world of beauty, passion, and freedom.\n\nSounds rather conservative, right?\n\nThus, it is irresponsible and irrational to think that sustainability is a radical, uncontrolled, deceitful ideology. It is essential that you truly believe and contribute to building a safe, sustainable global environment, before it's too late.\n\n#10ENG ",

In the film, large metallic warships from the Tolmekian Empire aggressively attack the Valley of the Wind, smashing through a windmill. This emotionless destruction of the windmill symbolises the Tolmekian's strength and dominance over the Valley of the Wind, and their ideals of human connection with nature. Furthermore, the extensive symbolism of metal within the Tolmekian ranks highlights a lack of sympathy and attention to nature. This dehumanises the Tolmekians, presenting their relationship with metal and by extension technology as detrimental to nature. Thus, by utilising symbolism, the text represents two societies at odds regarding the prevalence of climate change.",

(7 marks) **3**\nThe Haber process is an epic process discovered by my favourite German Fritz Haber (not endorsing the bad things Haber did). \n\nPrevious to Haber's discovery, it was theorised that Ammonia could be synthesised via a reaction between Nitrogen and Hydrogen gas:\n\n$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} \\to 2NH_{3(l)}$\n\nHowever, due to the high activation energy of this reaction, there were no widely available processes to synthesise Ammonia. (Frank-Caro and Birkeland-Eyde were inefficient)\n\nHaber used a Magnetite ($Fe_{3}O_{4}$) catalyst to significantly reduce the activation energy, allowing the reaction to occur under reasonable conditions.\n\na) Christian Choe Enterprises wants to produce fertilizer for their tomato plants. Their partner company uses a Nickel catalyst to react 12L of Hydrogen gas with excess Nitrogen gas. Under correct conditions, what is the maximum amount of Ammonia gas that can be produced, in moles? (2 marks)\n\n*1 mark, used wrong formula and mole calculation was rough, but working out is correct.*\n\nb) Upon condensing the products of this reaction, workers of the partner company found that the amount of Ammonia produced was less than predicted. Give a reason as to why this is the case. (2 marks)\n\n*0 marks, binding energy does not apply in chemistry.

(1 mark)\n\n*1 mark*\n\nb) How many grams of precipitate is produced? (3 marks)\n\n*3 marks*\n\n4. (7 marks) **2**\nHenry Bui is feeling sad today, and considers using Phosphoric acid. He finds that he needs 6 moles of Protons ($H^{+}$) to do what he wants to do.\n\n$$H_{3}PO_{4(aq)} \\to 3H^{+}_{(aq)} + PO_{4(aq)}^{3-}$$\n\na) Assuming all molecules of phosphoric acid ionise into protons in solution, how many grams of phosphoric acid does Henry need? (2 marks)\n\n*1 mark, did not establish mole ratio*\n\nb) Henry adds the required amount of phosphoric acid into a large container of water. Has the container increased or decreased in pH? (1 mark)\n\n*1 mark*\n\nc) Upon evaluating the good things in life, Henry forgoes his plans and decides to neutralise the container. He adds 200g of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$), which undergoes the following reaction:\n\n$NaOH_{(aq)} + H^{+}_{(aq)} \\to Na^{+}_{{(aq)}} + H_{2}O_{(l)}$\n\nAssuming the whole 200g of $NaOH$ reacts, will this be enough to remove all the added Protons ($H^+$)? (4 Marks)\n\n*no marks awarded, this is what should've been done:*\n- *convert 200g of NaOH into moles (5.00025001 mol)*\n- *$\\therefore$ 5.00025001 mol of $H^+$ react (1:1 mole ratio)*\n- *remaining $H^+$ = 6 - 5.00025001 = 0.99974999 mol of $H^+$ left*\n- ***thus, not all of the protons are removed.***\n\n5.

(2 marks)\n\n*just 2 marks. its because AlI_3 is blah blah blah, not aluminium triiodide. what i wanted to indicate was that aluminium triiodide fulfils **covalent** nomenclature, not ionic, which is the nature of AlI_3. but i give botd*\n\nb) Frederick shows this answer to his teacher and gets publically embarrassed. Now Frederick wants to do bad things to the whole class. He considers burning octane with limited oxygen. \n\nWhat is the reaction Frederick is thinking of?

Had to use knowledge of Volume -\u003e mole (NOTE THAT I STATED GASSEOUS OCTANE, THIS WAS BIG BOI HINT) to find mass/mole of octane and oxygen that reacted.*\n\ne) Frederick's life meets a tragic end when he fails to wear correct PPE, and while he successfully produces $CO$, he succumbs to $CO$ poisoning.\n\nWhat are the hazards of the reaction above, and what was the risk it posed to Frederick's health? (2 marks)\n\n*distinguish between hazard vs risk. hazard is the things it can do to you, e.g. its poisonous, deadly, risk is the literally things that may happen to you in relation, e.g. you inhale the CO, CO is absorbed by your blood stream, your organs fail, etc. you get 1 mark for identifying a risk.*\n\nf) The reaction mentioned above is in reference to 2 distinct reactions that can occur under similar conditions. Name all the possible products of the branch of reactions the reaction mentioned above falls under. (3 marks)\n\n*1 mark. complete combustion does not fall under the branch of incomplette combustion, thus you lose a mark. I asked for you to name them, not write a list of reactions. this also cost you a mark.*",

    "content": "\n## Defining the Gothic\n- Came to prominence in the late 18th century\n- Tales of mystery and the supernatural\n- often closely linked to horror, but never goes for shock factor. Rather it unsettles us with its transgressive elements\n\t- Death \n\t- Decay\n\t- Darkness\n\t- Madness and the human mind\n\t- Isolation and outsiders\n\t- Monsters and the monstrous\n\t- Interest in the old, forgotten, or shunned aspects of human society and culture\n\n## Gothic as a genre\n- As a literary genre, Gothic literature aims to confront its readers with all of these uncivilised, fearful, and 'old' things that bubble away beneath society's mask of modern civility.\n- Part of its aim is to remind us of the inevitable 'dark side' that remains despite human progress.\n\n\n## Beginnings of the genre\n- English authors in mid 1700\n- Novels interested in hauntings, the supernatural ,etc.\n- Counters the enlightenment obsession with progress etc via stories that fixate on the past\n\t- Ancestral curses\n\t- Ancient secrets discovered\n\t- Things coming back to haunt people\n- Old castles, monasteries etc, as settings\n\t- Emphasises the decay of major social institutions\n\n## Victorian Gothic\n- Mid to late 1800s\n- Genre begins to wane in mainstream popularity\n- Interest in human psychology\n\t- New discoveries about the mind, mental illness, etc.\n\t- Acknowledgement of the fact that the mind is volatile, suspect to madness\n\t- Characters with split identities, prone to violence etc.\n- Gritty, urban settings reflect the transition to city life\n\t- Poverty, disease, corruption etc.\n\t- Victorian London a popular settings.\n- Edgar Allen Poe\n- Robert Louis Stevenson (*The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde*) 1886\n\n# Victorian Gothic\n- By the Victorian era, Gothic was no longer the dominant genre and had been dismissed by most critics. Its opularity had declined as the popularity of the historical romance rose.\n- However the Gothic was actually entering its most creative and diverse phase. Many critics rare now revisiting some of the overlooked \"penny dreadful\" pieces from this time. such as George W.M. Reynolds' trilogy, *Faust*, *Wagner the Wehr-wolf*, etc.\n- Accorded importance in the development of the urban space as a particularly Victorian Gothic setting A style linked with established reading of iconic writers such as Charles Dickens\n\n- The Gothic influenced numerous writers of this time and was a heavy influence on mainstream authors such as Charles Dickens.\n- Dickens read Gothic literature as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own fiction, whilst shifting them to a more modern period and urban setting - think Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Great Expectations.\n- They explored the juxtaposition of wealthy, ordered and affluent society next to the disorder, decay and barbarity of the poor and criminal classes within the same urban spaces. - urban fog is a frequent characteristic or urban Gothic literature and film.\n\n## Gothic influence\n- The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians, with their morbid obsession with mourning rituals, mementos, and mortality in general.The 1880s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to fin de siecle, which fictionalised contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time.\n\n### Influential classic Gothic texts\n- Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\n- The Picture of Dorian Grray\n- Trilby\n- The Beetle: A Mystery\n- The Turn of the Screw\n\n",

  "/History-of-the-Atomic-Model-Notes": {
    "title": "History of the Atomic Model Notes",
    "content": "# History of the Atomic Model \n\n**Democritus** (460 - 370 BCE) describes matter as **infinitely** divisible and proposes matter is made up for **tiny indivisible particles, with nothing between them but empty space.** He names these particles “Atomos”, which means “uncuttable or indivisible” in Greek.\n    \nThe term “element” is coined by **Robert Boyle**’s _The Sceptical Chymist_. Boyle defined an element as a substance that **could not decompose into other substances**. (Essentially indivisible).\n    \n**Law of conservation of mass: Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier** conducts numerous experiments, such as heating tin to form ‘calxes’ (metal oxides). Lavoisier pioneered the use of precise numerical measurements, and concluded that there was **no change in mass** during a chemical reaction.\n    \n **John Dalton:**\n    \n(1803-1808)\n    \nJohn Dalton came up with a theory of atomic matter:\n    \n1.  Elements are composed of extremely small indivisible particles called atoms.\n2.  All atoms of a given element are identical having the same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have a different size, mass and chemical properties.\n3.  Atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types during a chemical reaction.\n4.  A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.\n5.  Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific simple whole-number ratio.\n    \nNOTE: Following a modern understanding of atomic structure, Points 1-2 and 5 are incorrect. Atoms can be divided into subatomic particles, Atoms of the same element may have different masses (isotopes), and elements do not always combine in the simplest whole-number ratios. (e.g. sucrose ($C_{11}H_{22}0_{11}$))\n    \n**The law of definite proportions:**\n    \nDalton proposed: “compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.” This is true given our modern understanding of chemistry, as Calcium oxide, for example, will occur with Ca and O atoms in some fixed ratio\n    \n**The law of conservation of mass:**\n    \n Dalton proposed: “atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types; a chemical reaction involves separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.” Thus, there must be the same amount of atoms in the reactants of a chemical reaction as the atoms in the product.\n\n**The law of multiple proportions:**\n    \nDalton proposed: “Whenever two elements form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the other element is always a whole number ratio.” 95% sure this is wrong\n    \nWhy is Dalton wrong?\n    \nHe had a rule of ‘greatest simplicity’, which made some of his calculations incorrect. He assumed water was HO, and ammonia NH. Because of this, his measurements for the weight of oxygen was wrong by half of its actual value. Similarly, he made no suggestions for the structure of the atom.\n    \nWhy is Dalton right?\n    \nHe identified elements as consisting of indestructible particles called atoms. Good on him, but his calculations were bad\n\n**Dimitri Mendeleev**:\n\n(1868-71)\n\nMendeleev is credited with being the first to describe elements within a 'table', and represent this table according to patterns and properties he identified.\n\nHe published a book called *Osnovy khimii*, or **The Principles of Chemistry**. In this book, he established that orderings of atomic weights could be used to create **groupings**. \n\nHis goal was to create an ordered system to break down and make sense of the chemical/properties of elements known at the time, which were disjointed and confusing.\n\nGoing on, he would state that \"elements arranged accordingly to the value of their atomic weights presents a clear periodicity of properties\". This is where the “period” in “periodic table” comes from. Essentially, he correlated atomic weight to **valency**.\n\n```He could correlate valency as John Newlands had discovered the Law of Octaves, stating that every 8th element has similar behaviours to one another.```\n\nBased on his calculations, Mendeleev created an elaborate table, with spots for undiscovered elements and even suggestions for the correct values of atomic weight of certain elements. \n\nThis table would be validated due to the discovery of gallium, scandium, and germanium (1875-1886), which fit into Mendeleev's periodic table.\n\n**J.J. Thomson:**\n    \n(1897)\n    \nJ.J Thomson would pick up the work of Michael Faraday, who discovered the electrical properties of atoms. Working alongside other scientists (Julius Plucker, Sir William Crookes), he developed the **cathode ray**.\n       \nEssentially, a cathode (negative terminal) would release these rays towards the anode within a partially evacuated glass tube (cathode ray tube(CRT)). Cathode rays would cause gasses to glow like Neon in a sign. They found that a cathode ray can be affected by other negative/positive plates, and by a magnetic field.\n    \nThomson stated that the material of the cathode did not affect the cathode rays. He assumed that they were not a form of radiation but negatively charged particles with some mass. These particles were electrons, which is why Thomson is credited with their discovery.\n    \nThomson used both properties of cathode rays, being that they are deflected by both magnetic fields and charged metal plates, to adjust the strengths of both tools so the cathode rays would be unaffected. This would allow Thomson to determine the charge to mass ratio ($q_e/m_e$) for the cathode ray particles (electrons). The ratio he determined was about $1.76 \\times 10^{-8}$ coulombs per gram. Knowing the charge to mass ratio of aqueous ions, Thomson estimated the mass of an electron to be less than a thousandth the mass of the lightest atom, Hydrogen.\n    \nThis proved that **atoms must be divisible.**\n    \n```Later on, Robert Millikan used Thomson’s charge to mass ratio to find the mass of an atom, $9.11 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg, which is 1/1800 of the mass of a hydrogen atom.```\n\nThomson’s model of the atom was pretty weird.\n    \nAt that time, it was known that matter was made up of atoms, which was electrically neutral.\n    \nIt was also known that there were negatively charged particle known as electrons, with a very small fraction of the size of an actual atom.\n    \nSo, Thomson proposed the plum pudding model, where negatively charged electrons were embedded within a larger uniformly positively charged sphere, like plums in plum pudding. This sphere would account for the majority of an atom’s mass.\n\n![[plum-pudding-model.jpg]]\n    \n**Other stuff:**\n(1906)\nThomson used positive rays to discover Neon in 2 different types of atoms (its charge/mass ratio was different). Thus, he discovered isotopes in a stable element.\n    \n**Ernest Rutherford:**\n    \n(1911)\n    \nRutherford, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, use alpha particles (2+ charged helium nuclei, literally helium without its electrons) on gold foil.\n    \nAssuming Thomson’s model was correct, positively charged alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection, **because** the positive charge/mass would be thinly and uniformly spread out across the atom.\n\nIn the gold foil experiment, a beam of alpha particles (+2 charged helium nuclei without electrons) were emitted from a radioactive material (radium), where they would hit a thin gold foil.\n\nWhen the beam interacted with the gold foil, flashes of light could be detected using a microscope, as a result of the alpha particles hitting a Zinc Sulphide screen surrounding the gold foil.\n![[Pasted image 20220319200331.png]]\n    \nThe Gold foil experiment found that most alpha-particles incurred no deflection, however some alpha particles were greatly deflected, even back into their own direction.\n\nSimply put, Thomson's model could not explain the results of the gold foil experiment.\n![[Pasted image 20220319200435.png]]\n\nThus, Thomson’s model was disproven, as the deflection suggested a variance in the mass of an atom, with the majority of mass being concentrated in an area.\n    \nRutherford proposed a new model, with an atom consisting of mostly empty space occupied by electrons, which orbited a tiny central region known as a **nucleus**. In this model, all positive charge is in the nucleus and all negative charge is found in the electrons. This explains why the alpha particles were so greatly deflected, as although most particles passed through the empty space, some particles would go close or impact the dense and positively charged nucleus, which would deflect them.\n    \n**Niels Bohr**:\n    \n(1913)\n    \nRutherford’s model also did not account for **emissions spectra (aka line spectra)**. Low pressure gasses and vaporised elements would produce these spectra when excited by electricity.\n    \nSimilarly, based on classical physics, an electron constantly moving around would cause it to radiate energy, losing its energy and speed as it is pulled into the nucleus. This would mean **all atoms are unstable,** **which is wrong.**\n    \nNiels Bohr applied quantum theory to solve this problem with unstable electron orbits and accounted for the emissions spectra.\n    \nHe proposed that electrons **moved around** the nucleus in circular orbits, however there were only specific orbital radii. He also assumed that an electron in an orbit would have a specific amount (quanta) of energy, where the closest orbital to the nucleus would have the least amount of energy.\n    \nHe also hypothesised that a photon would be emitted from an excited electron, which was an electron not at its ground state, which is the lowest possible **electron quantum level** (energy states), as it fell to a lower energy orbit. **NOTE: The energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the 2 orbits.** The frequency of the photon could be determined using the formula $E_{photon} = hf$, where $h$ = $6.626\\times10^{-34}$ and $f$ = frequency. However, Bohr went against classical physics by proposing that electrons would orbit a nucleus without losing energy.\n    \nThus, Bohr determined the energy associated with each of the electron energy states of the hydrogen atom. Using this, Bohr could calculate the wavelengths of light that corresponded to the emissions spectra of hydrogen. He was pretty correct. Good job.\n    \nBohr’s model accurately described emissions spectra. Similarly, it explained the formation of absorption spectra, as electrons would only allow photons of a specific energy that corresponded to the difference between the energy state it would move to and its current one to excite them. The electrons would absorb the photons, but not the ones that weren’t the right energy. This created the absorption spectra, which outlined the wavelengths of visible light that were absorbed.\n    \nBohr’s model describes the electron’s smallest orbit corresponds to its lowest energy state, which he called the ground state. Because of this, Bohr established atomic stability, as the electrons won’t crash into the nucleus given they cant go below the ground state, which will always be a positive radius from the nucleus.\n\n\n**Henry Moseley**:\n\n(1920s)\n\nBefore Moseley, it was believed that atomic number was continuous and was loosely defined. Essentially, Moseley used experiments to prove that atomic numbers could be rationalised from the physical state of an atom's X-ray spectra.\n\n\n**Francis William Aston**:\n\n(1920)\n\nHaving considered the possibility of **isotopes**, Aston set out to find a way to analyse and detect isotopes.\n\nHe would pioneer **mass spectrometry** (an analytical technique used to measure the mass to charge ratio of an element's ions.)\n\nUsing his own mass spectrometer, Aston identified the isotopes of Neon, Chlorine, and Mercury. He also wrote books, *Isotopes* and *Mass-spectra and Isotopes*.\n\n\n**Jean Baptiste Perrin**:\n\n(1926)\n\nPerrin's contribution derived from Albert Einstein's paper titled \"Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement\", discussing the idea that particles suspended in a fluid moved random due to collision with other atoms.\n\nHe studied 'colloids', which is a mixture consisting of an insoluble yet microscopically dispersed substance suspended within another substance.\n\nIn essence, while Einstein did all the math for Brownian motion, Perrin used experimental data to prove the validity of Brownian motion. Furthermore, he proved that colloids obey the gas laws.\n\n```You don't need to know about the gas laws, but if you're interested heres a website: https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Properties_of_Gases/Gas_Laws/Gas_Laws%3A_Overview```\n\n\nHe could then use that knowledge to calculate Avogadro's Number, or the number of molecules per grammolecule (gram/relative atomic mass) of a gas.\n\n\n**Erwin Schrödinger:**\n    \n(1926 - Early 20s)\n    \nBohr’s model had some issues, because there was no reason for electron orbits to be quantised, and no reason for “atomic stability” (wow lucarelli, very descriptive, it essentially asks why the ground state orbit was the lowest energy state for the electron(ground state = $E_1$)). Also, it could not successfully predict the emissions spectrum of atoms that had more than one electron. (It could only predict emissions spectrum for $H$, $He^+$, $Li^{2+}$, etc.)\n    \n(1924)\n    \n\n```During the early 20s, **Louis de Broglie** proposed that electrons could have a wave and particle nature, much like light acting like a particle and a wave.```\n\n    \nThis wave nature would explain the discrete (quantised) energy **states**.\n    \nBecause of this, Schrödinger and **Werner Heisenberg** developed a new quantum mechanical theory for the electronic structure of the atom, the **Wave mechanical model.**\n    \nIn their model of the atom, electrons do not orbit the nucleus, instead Schrödinger treated them as mathematical waves. Schrödinger’s model is purely based on quantum ideas. Electrons had a probability of being found at a certain position. In this model, electrons don’t have specific path, but a probability of being in a location at a specific time. (sounds a lot like quantum physics because it is :)) Rather than neat, clean orbitals, Schrödinger’s model proposed electrons inhabited a “cloud”, and where the cloud is most dense is the most likely place to find an electron. - suborbital levels now exist, also the cloud has 99.99999% of the atom’s volume, but literally none of its actual mass.\n\n**Sir James Chadwick:**\n\n(1932)\n\nRutherford’s model did not account for all the mass. Data from Hans Geiger and Ernst Marden showed that the mass of protons in the nucleus was half the atom’s mass. This meant that, at best, protons accounted for half an atom’s overall mass. Thus, some neutral particles must be present somewhere in the nucleus (they knew it wasn’t in the electrons, because mass was concentrated in the nucleus).\n\t\nChadwick found neutrons as a by-product of the bombardment of Beryllium with alpha particles.\n",

  "/Jekyll-and-Hyde-Exemplar": {
    "title": "Jekyll and Hyde Exemplar",
    "content": "\n**Year 11 Literature Jekyll and Hyde Exemplar**\n\n**Question: Explain how the use of imagery, alongside symbolism and/or allusion, is crafted to explore one or more ideas in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.**\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a Gothic novella written by author Robert Louis Stevenson and first published in 1886. It follows London legal practitioner named Gabriel John Utterson as he investigates the mysterious occurrences between the respected Dr Henry Jekyll and the malevolent Mr Edward Hyde. As the story progresses it is revealed that Hyde is the alter-ego of Jekyll, separated from his consciousness into a new person through a radical scientific process in order to quell the constant internal antagonisms felt by Jekyll as a result of his conflicting desires. In doing so, Jekyll developed a monster of pure evil, stripped of any moral reason by which to control himself. Throughout the story, these two men become hyperbolic symbols of the dual parts within each individual. Through the development of this idea of duality, we see the influence of great minds of Stevenson’s time shining through, most notable that of Charles Darwin. With the publishment of The Origin of Species in 1859, it seems natural that an agnostic mind like Stevenson would take to his profound new ideas about human nature, including the distinction between the civilized part of man and the enduring qualities of our evolutionary background. A second thinker who influences the moral composition of the text is that of Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher who released many philosophical readings through the late 1700s. He also made the distinction between the part of our minds accountable for reason, and that associated with our non-rational impulses. In the novella, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, author Robert Louis Stevenson employs symbolism, imagery, and allusion in order to explore Darwinian and Kantian ideas regarding the human condition.\n\nStevenson employs language features including symbolism and imagery to construct the foil characters of Hyde and Jekyll in order to explore the dual nature of man. The duality of man is a philosophical idea stating that there exist two sides of a person, that of the civilized, moral, and reasonable, and that of the barbaric, immoral, and impulsive. The internal divide is made plain by the literal divide of Henry Jekyll, with the creation of Hyde, who represents all about Jekyll that is unfavourable. A description of the two juxtaposing personas can be found in the surroundings around them, by which Stevenson expresses their nature through sensory imagery. In the case of Jekyll: “a comfortable hall… warmed by a bright open fire and furnished with costly cabinets of oak” These are the words that describe the entrance to Dr Jekyll’s home, and upon first glance the reader is presented with attractive visual imagery, developing a sense of good-naturedness along with the warm tactile imagery, as if the reader can feel the welcoming flames of the fire. Furthermore, the consonance associated with “costly cabinets of oak”, adds a calming, rhythmic effect to the end of the sentence which only enhances the gratifying mood. These qualities become symbolic of the benevolent and respectable nature of the good side of Dr Jekyll. Alternatively, in the case of Hyde, the book reads: “This mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare”. With this sentence, the reader is stricken with the harrowing image of Soho, the place of Hyde’s residence. The macabre imagery develops a sense of anxiety for one’s safety, as if the unexpected has become the expected. Such a place provides a flawless embodiment of the characteristics of Edward Hyde; evil, impulsive, and uncontrolled. With this Stevenson solidifies the characterization of Jekyll and Hyde as a fierce dichotomy in ideals, alluding to the Darwinian idea of duality. To quote the great thinker: “Man still bears in his bodily frames the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.”\n\nIn the novella, the characters of Jekyll and Hyde are used in order to allude to ideas of Kantian ethics. Philosopher Immanuel Kant theorised that it is the ability to reason that makes the distinction of morality, stating that while most elements of nature are acted upon, humans being rational individuals are actors in themselves. To quote: “The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil”. In the novella, this concept is echoed through the evil alter-ego of Hyde and can be seen in the quote: “Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost”. Here a key difference is highlighted between the two men, and that is of their conscious nature. While Jekyll is subject to deep contemplation over his actions, Hyde possesses no such ability, and consequentially seems to act purely on his instinctual and emotional thought. According to Kant, the riddance of this conscience is what enables Hyde to commit such atrocities, as he cannot comprehend the fundamental wrongness of his actions. This idea is explored further when Stevenson writes: “These two base passions raged within him like a tempest”. The “two base passions” Jekyll refers to in this quote are that of fear and anger, the primary motives of Hyde in his heinous doings. These emotions can be classified under what Kant would call our irrational impulses; existing as the lowest form of thinking and having no grounds to act morally. Stevenson uses the simile of a “tempest” to further illustrate the hysterical state of mind Hyde experiences due to his lack of reason. The “two base passions” could also be read as an allusion to Plato’s metaphor of the chariot, comparing Hyde to the black horse who has been freed from the reigns of the charioteer. Plato had a large influence on Kant’s theories, especially those of reason, which are embedded into Stevenson’s novella.\n\nSymbolism and allusion have been manipulated in Stevenson’s novella in order to explore ideas of Darwinian evolution and Christianity. In 1873, 13 years before the publication of the novella, it was made public that Stevenson had lost the Christian faith that he was brought up in. This was not an uncommon occurrence, as secularization in Britain was an increasing trend that has continued to this day. Such a process was set off by the increase in publications of scientific papers that contradicted the ideas of the church, including those of Charles Darwin, who’s theory of evolution was greatly influential throughout the Victorian era. His theories are alluded to in the text through the construction of Hyde as a symbol of our lingering evolutionary past, seen in the quote: “with ape-like fury he was trampling his victim under foot” Here Hyde is characterized as an animalistic being, not only in appearance, but in mind as well, as his motivations for the murder were no more complex than a burst of “ape-like fury”. Through this sub-human description of Hyde, he becomes a symbol for the remnants of our evolutionary ancestry, hidden deep within every human being, as he is within Dr Jekyll. In doing this Stevenson also participates in the gothic trope of dissolving conceptual boundaries with the corrosion of the preconceived human-animal dichotomy. This is further explored in the quote: “the animal within me licking the chops of memory”, here, in Jekyll’s full statement of the case, he refers to Hyde as an animal that hides within him, representing his primitive and irrational thoughts. Through this presentation of the mind of Jekyll, Stevenson confronts the audience with the idea that they too may have an animal within them, further blurring their distinction between human and animal, and alluding to the theory of evolution. Further atheist sentiments can be read in the text including in the expression “empty as a church”, casually uttered by Mr Enfield at the start of the story but can be seen as a play-on-words in order to allude to the idea of the increasing secularization in Victorian London. It could also symbolise Stevenson’s personal distaste for the church stating that it is “empty” of moral value or truth.\n\nIn The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, symbolism, imagery, and allusion have been employed in order to explore Darwinian and Kantian ideas regarding human nature. The dual nature of the mind is an idea explored in a Darwinian context and is also utilised to allude to Kantian morality. The author also expresses atheist ideas through an endorsement of the theory of evolution and a subsequent critique of Christianity. Stevenson leaves readers in a state of chilling introspection, causing them to question their most basic assumptions about themselves and the people around them.",

  "/Lit-Close-Readings": {
    "title": "Lit Close Readings",
    "content": "\n\"back to melbourne\" is a postmodernist poem discussing an individual's experience with the city of Melbourne. The text presents Melbourne as an emotionless, cruel city that neglects its citizens. My interpretation of the text is that through consonance, anaphora and imagery it critiques the concept of identity within the context of Melbourne, where the city's social and cultural setting is dysfunctional.\n\nThrough consonance, the poem presents the repetitive characteristics of life in Melbourne from a cynical perspective. The persona is shown to \"find carlton cappuccino coffee comfort\". In using consonance, the text emphasises the over-complicated lifestyle individuals live in Melbourne, with a basic item like coffee having multiple, excessive labels attached to it. The text criticises the artificiality of Melbourne's lifestyle, by cynically highlighting the excessive stylisation of generic goods. Furthermore, in using consonance to highlight the \"manicured madonnas\", the text brings to light the artificiality of women that excessively modify their beauty. In conveying that the women in Melbourne are heavily manicured, the text reinforces the stigma of artificial beauty taking prevalence within Melbourne's society and thus condemns the norms of synthetic beauty prevalent in Melbourne. Thus, through consonance, the text critiques how social norms in Melbourne revolve around artificiality and redundancy.\n\nIn using anaphora, the text presents Melbourne life as dull, repetitive and full of emotionally abusive people. By describing how the persona would \"find the same faces in the same places in the same spaces\", the text uses anaphora of the word \"same\" to convey to readers that life in Melbourne is stagnant and predictable. The text presents Melbourne's society as boring yet ruthless, with the persona finding \"lovers that once sucked and bit and kissed and licked\". By utilizing imagery, the text presents the reader with a visual description of love in Melbourne; melodramatic, painful and abusive. In doing so, the text directly attacks how love in Melbourne as a social activity has become corrupted with cruelty. Thus, through anaphora and imagery, the text portrays culture in Melbourne as both monotonous and emotionally soul-crushing.\n\n\n{hook statement}\n\"lygon street, carlton, victoria: sunday morning\" by Greek-Australian author Komninos presents itself as an observation of an average Sunday morning in Lygon street. My interpretation is that Komninos portrays life within Australian society as filled with a social focus predominantly on appearance. Komninos questions the concept of an ideal family, mocking those who parade their children and use them as symbols of familial success.\n\nThrough figurative language, the poem draws attention to the manner in which girls present themselves to society down Lygon street. In using simile to depict the \"girls, that look like parrots\", the poem likens the girls to parrots, which are an exotic animal known for their vibrant, flashy appearance. The poem presents life down Lygon street as colourful, filled with women with impressive clothing. However, as the colours commonly displayed by parrots are rare in nature, the poem cynically presents women's fashion as artificial and excessive. Thus, using a simile, the poem comments on how women present themselves in the context of Melbourne, a large city in Australia, as both radiant yet artificial and over-the-top.\n{my perception}\n\nFurthermore, visual imagery is utilised to critique how society forces people to construct a facade around their family life, causing uproar among the audience. The poem depicts \"pushers\" that are \"full of children / just out for a midday stroll\", and in doing so projects to audiences an image of a mass of strollers packed with children, crowding the street. The poem intends for audiences to react with disdain at the mass of strollers, who openly present their children. In doing so, the poem condemns how guardians of children conform to the societal expectation of placing their young on display. The poem presents Australian society as placing their children on a pedestal, which makes the reader respond with disgust. Thus, through visual imagery, the poem demands for the audience to resist against society's demand of them to excessively flail their children around like trophies.\n{context for both }",

    "content": "\n**Chapter 1: Solace**\n\nTears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs. At last, Columbia had reached the riparian of the lake. She dipped her hands into the water. A bolt of frost shot through her arms, the perspiration of the clouds immediately deepened as the blue above darkened, and divine light struck the lake. Columbia fell away from the water in shock, as the breeze started pushing her into the arms of the forest. She could hear the winds cry out in pain, the once still lake erupting in violent gushes. The wails quickly turned dormant, as the wind halted, and the lake became silent once again. \n\nLooking down at her chest, Columbia drew her attention to the eloquent dances of a fine garnet gem, projecting an aura of grandiose as the centrepiece of the necklace around her neck. It was a gift from her parents, a symbol of their love for her before their untimely murder. Holding back her tears as fond memories of her parents flooded her thoughts, Columbia quaintly moved her fingers towards the gem.\n\nImmediately as the tip of her fingers made contact with the gleaming gem, a wave of pain rippled through her mind, like blades of steel puncturing her head.  A raw layer of maroon exuded into her vision, as her other sensations dimmed. Columbia fell to the floor, an unknown force crushing her breath deep down her throat. However, as quickly as the pain shot through her head, it disappeared. Columbia opened her eyes, making out her distorted, liminal surroundings through her blood-red vision. A sense of confusion struck Columbia, only to be soothed by a voice she hadn't heard in years.\n\nColumbia turned around to see her father. She saw him clench his rifle tightly. He had been expecting an attack from the British ever since Madison's Congress declared war. When their eyes met, a shard of sadness pierced her heart. To Columbia's disappointment, there was no compassion in the cloudy, glass spheres resting within his eye sockets. With his mouth wide open, he charged into the forest, with Columbia following closely. Dashing through the loose leaves and branches, Columbia kept her eyes trained on the figure of her father as gunshots rang out around her. At last, a final, deafening shot oscillated throughout the stale air. Columbia stopped to see her father clasp his chest, with an achromatic liquid discharged into his palms. He quickly rummaged through his left pocket to pull out a silvery locket. Columbia was shocked to see a faint picture of her alongside her father within. With tears flowing from her eyes, Columbia quietly observed as her father pulled the locket close to his chest, as the life faded from his body. As raw emotion overwhelmed Columbia, she fell to the ground as her father vanished, sobbing furiously.\n\nIn the distance, the anxious murmurs of forest wildlife were interrupted by a dissonant shriek. Columbia looked up to see herself on the bank of the lake in the embrace of her mother, surrounded by a group of British soldiers. Although she was a great distance away from the scene, Columbia could hear her mother comfort her, with words she had forgotten. \"I'm sorry, my precious daughter. I've failed you. I've failed as your mother, your caregiver, and your creator. I won't be able to help you in your journey through life. If my sacrifice today leads to your survival, then it is the least I can do. Now get in the boat, and leave.\" Columbia tearfully watched herself climb into the boat, as her mother let the soldiers slash at her with their swords. Glancing over, Columbia saw herself frantically setting sail to her fragile boat, drifting off into the distance. But unlike what she remembered, she watched wordlessly as the Columbia in the boat was swallowed by the waves of the lake. A tide of water pummelled over her head, reaching at her throat with cold, forceful hands. Before losing her breath, Columbia felt the sharp metallic edges of the necklace's chain grazing her skin. Pushing against the water, she tore the necklace off her neck.\n\nColumbia felt the coarse sand on her back and stood up to see the necklace in the palm of her hand, and her feet planted at the shore of the lake. She was relieved to see the crimson in her vision had lifted. She clenched her fist and threw the necklace into the deep end of the water, watching as it elegantly sank like a stone. Tears of comfort fell from Columbia's eyes, as she came to the realisation that her parents wanted her to be happy, and died for her. Although the burden of their deaths still laid heavy on her shoulder, she was ready to move on. She dived into the lake, and with fluidity floated gently at the surface.",

    "title": "Literature In Class Essay + Planning",
    "content": "\n# Literature In Class Essay\n\nWorks of literature are often classified into genres based on similar themes and tropes, but unique aspects of texts set them apart from their genre. \"The Hunger Games\" (2008) by Suzanne Collins is a young adult romantic novel that follows Katniss Everdeen's experience as a tribute of the Hunger Games, a televised event where tributes must kill each other to win. Produced at the height of American societal anxiety over conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, the text is recognisably dystopian, but undermines past dystopian themes as it adapts to the young adult fiction genre. The text conforms to dystopian tropes in its presentation of an oppressive and unequal society, where fear and apathy towards hope for positive societal change keeps its citizens reticent. However, Collins subverts the traditional dystopian genre by presenting the stability of Panem's totalitarian regime as waning, and through portraying humane, emotional ideas not commonly explored in established dystopian literature, such as love and social relationships. \n\nThrough imagery and passive diction, Collins adheres to the dystopian genre by presenting how the citizens of Panem are conditioned to submit to their oppression. Collins contrasts the apathy of District 12 for freedom from the authoritarian state with the lack of physical resistance to escape, conforming to the strongly dystopian theme of society giving way to oppression by means of neglect and indifference towards oppression. In the text, Katniss informs readers of the security surrounding District 12, describing a \"high chain-linked fence topped with barbed-wire loops\", that separates District 12 from the outside world. The use of visual imagery for the wall highlights the power of the Capitol, while disempowering the citizens of District 12, as they submit to the removal of their fundamental freedom of movement. Collins utilizes the wall as a symbol of tyranny to reinforce the dystopian nature of Panem's society, and the power imbalance between government and the people. In a modern society where free movement is commonplace, the idea of a wall strikes fear and concern in readers such as myself, unlike the citizens of District 12 who have been desensitised to their lack of freedom. Furthermore, Collins conveys the dejected attitude of those selected for the Hunger Games, when Katniss retells how \"we are taken into custody. I don't mean we're handcuffed or anything\". Katniss' colloquial diction, through nonchalantly saying \"or anything\", implores readers to contemplate the presentation of law and order in Panem. Katniss' compliance with being forced into the Hunger Games without handcuffs presents how hopeless tributes like Katniss are for their situation. In contemporary context, this scenario would be risible as one would expect violent physical opposition to such injustice, however Katniss' apathy to her fate upholds the dystopian trope of citizens blindly accepting misjustice. Thus, through the use of dialogue and imagery, Collins' text conforms to the dystopian genre in its portrayal of a defunct society, where the citizens of District 12 can not imagine a world without Panem's oppressive government.\n\nCollins utilizes character voice of the protagonist and side characters to present Panem's social order as strong, but giving way to unrest and upheaval, subverting the dystopian trope of a stable government. Katniss recounts to the audience the universal resentment towards the Capitol, describing how \"not one person claps... they take part in the boldest form of dissent... Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.\" The auditory imagery of the silence conveyed through short, sharp syntax highlights how unpopular the Panem's government is. This presentation of unopposed public protest undermines the dystopian nature of Panem, confusing readers such as myself, who envision dystopian societies as one where loyalty to the state must be demonstrated at all time, and where acts of protest such as this would evoke immediate punishment. After Rue's death, Katniss emotionally states how \"It's the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all of us\". Through emotive words such as \"hate\", Katniss conveys to readers her hatred for the Capitol, presenting to audiences the atmosphere of discontent with the Capitol's oppressive rule. This subverts traditional dystopian texts, by disempowering Panem's government and its stability as an authoritarian regime. In presenting the people of Panem as disapproving, Collins appeals to a young adult audience, by romanticizing revolution and discontent against government and engaging teenage audiences through the promise of action. Thus, through using character voice, Collins undermines the dystopian genre by presenting an unhappy population, and presenting the Capitol's control over the people's emotions as weak.\n\nIn highlighting Katniss' emotions through dialogue and characterization, Collins subverts traditional dystopian texts in their focus on life as a citizen in a totalitarian, dystopian society, by instead focusing on more emotional themes, such as love and social relationships. Peeta tells Katniss \"we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.\" The use of affectionate diction surprises audiences, as it subverts expectations of a dystopian text. The idea that raw love can be so easily expressed in a ruthless, oppressive society such as Panem starkly contrasts dystopias where love is viewed as dangerous and sometimes illegal. This presentation of romance appeals to contemporary audiences, who live in societies where freely expressing love is a social norm. In the text, Katniss details her attitude towards children in the community home, describing how \"I could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim\". This contemplative and affectionate epistrophe characterises Katniss as caring for her sister like she was her mother. This explores their unique sororal relationship, which is unusual in a dystopian text, where it is conventional for there to be  a lack of individualism. In doing so, Collins subverts dystopian norms centred around the extent of totalitarianism in society, by presenting elements of love and emotion. As someone who reads the Hunger Games as modernist and liberal in its interpretation of the dystopian genre, I react with approval to Collins' humane representation of love in the text, and her appeal to the young adult audience. Thus, by utilizing characterization and diction, Collins aligns to the traditional portrayals of gender expected in conventional dystopian texts, but her inclusion of romance explores the scope of the dystopian genre, undermining founding dystopian texts.\n\nThrough symbolism, dialogue, characterisation and voice, Collins constructs a recognisably dystopian text that both conforms and subverts the dystopian genre. The society is dystopian in how it propagates apathy towards suffering, and the Panem government's totalitarian rule, yet its portrayal of a dissident, spiteful population and its unique representation of gender and romance subverts ideas found in texts such as George Orwell's \"1984\". In undermining traditional dystopian tropes, Collins intends to explore new perspectives of dystopian conventions, and modernises the genre for contemporary audiences. The text is an excellent example of a postmodernist work that revitalises traditional genres, in its incorporation of modern characteristics of text.\n\n**Quotes**\n- \"The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody.

    "content": "\nMy creative piece, *Solace* is a chapter of a Romantic anthology of short stories and tales of the experience of living through the War of 1812, and reflects on the tragedy of war as scarring on the psyches of young, innocent children. In using a short story style for my extract, I was able to vividly portray an individual's experience, and in doing so I could effectively write romantically, as I was able to include figurative devices and prevalent ideas of the Romantic era more freely within my text. The language of my piece draws heavy inspiration from the core themes of Romanticism, specifically its admiration of nature, and use of the supernatural. Furthermore, I use imagery frequently to immerse the reader, such as in the opening line \"Tears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs.\" This use of language is common in Romantic pieces, such as in Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. I intended for my overall anthology to be read by students of the Romantic era. My intention was that my story would give audiences fresh insight into the experience of individuals who fall victim to war. I hoped to present war as a tragedy of the human experience, and to portray those affected by war as deserving of more sympathy. I based my extract on the context of the Romantic era, a turbulent time in history that suffered through a plethora of wars. While I have not use specific texts as inspiration, I have chosen to discuss my own personal opinions towards war, a theme prevalent throughout the Romantic era, in a style expected of the Romantic era.",

    "content": "\n## Poem 1: Earth's Answer (Blake)\n\nFrom eco-critical lens:\n\n-          Talk about how Earth is portrayed as shackled and at the whim of humanity, contrast with anthropocentric views of society – deep ecology\n\nFrom generic reader lens:\n\nContext: Blake is a romantic poet, thus the tone of the poem tends to be critical of human industrialism/manipulation of environment. Blake also deifies the Earth, further projecting a sense of beauty and importance regarding nature.\n\n“Does the sower? / Sow by night? / Or the plowman in darkness plow?”\n\n-          Talk about humans being portrayed as lazy, tending to work in the day and rest at night, or how Blake creates a binary distinction between day and night.\n\n“Starry Jealousy does keep my den / Cold and hoar”\n\n-          Humans are portrayed as jealous of nature and its wonders, and thus humanity enslaves nature/the earth, making its beauty diminish to be “Cold and hoar”, i.e. drained, overworked\n\n“Does spring hide its joy / When buds and blossoms grow?”\n\n-          Blake adheres to standard romantic-era conventions by making reference to beauty of seasons via strong visual imagery. The audience is further led to explore their own feelings and emotions based on their experiences with nature, i.e. how they see springtime. Using personification to portray spring as feeling “joy / When buds and blossoms grow” informs audiences that the growth and blossoming of nature is beautiful and something that should be enjoyed.\n\n·       Literary texts often reflect the tenets of movements at the time. Today my group will be presenting our analysis on William Blake’s “Earth’s Answer”, a 1790 poem detailing a figure alluded to be Earth itself lamenting on being imprisoned by unknown means. Our overall reading is that the poem criticises the greediness of humanity and its misuse of nature’s resources, and humanity’s lack of appreciation of the beauty of nature. I will be analysing through an eco-critical lens, and will comment on how the anthropocentric views of society, both within contextual times and contemporary, result in the degradation of the aesthetic quality of nature, via a negligence of deep ecology in favour for seeing humanity as the superior species.\n\n·       Blake describes how Earth as an entity is “Prison’d on watry shore”, and is able to hear the “Selfish father of men”, who Earth labels as “Cruel, jealous, \\[and] selfish”. Through the use of visual imagery, the audience images a beautiful being of nature at the whim of the greedy humans, who misuse nature for their own benefit. We are further told that “Starry Jealousy does keep my den / Cold and hoar”. Blake implicates humanity as jealous of nature’s beauty and as a result humanity has resorted to extracting and draining nature of it’s vibrant resources. Blake uses visual imagery once again to paint Earth as old and decrepit due to society’s misuse of its resources. Furthermore, the symbolism of describing Earth’s lands as “my den” projects a sense of family, that is Earth sees humanity and other inhabitants as children who share in the land and its resources. Thus Blake describes to audiences the sense of betrayal in that humanity has backstabbed nature for its resources. The audience hears Earth question “Does the sower? / Sow by night?” Once again readers visualise the bright and colourful day contrasted with the dark yet intriguing night, and conclude that humanity rejects nature and its beauty by refusing to experience both day and night. In doing so humanity refutes the concept of deep ecology by neglecting the living beings of the night. Hence, through an eco-critical lens my interpretation is that humanity is portrayed as cruel, greedy and dismissive of nature and it’s beauty while misappropriating nature’s resources for its own benefit.\n\n## Poem 2: To the River (Coleridge)\n\nImagery:\n\n“I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast”\n\n-          The reader sees a youthful individual skipping stones across the river. Strong visual imagery is used to project the river as majestic and dynamic in its flow.\n\nSymbolism:\n\n“Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes / I never shut amid the sunny ray”\n\n-          The river is portrayed as a symbol of childhood, innocence, etc. In doing so the river and by extension nature is portrayed in a positive light as a key environmental element as part of a stage in human’s life.\n\nRepetition:\n\n“Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey, / And bedded sand that, veined with various dyes”\n\n-          Coleridge gives an exhaustive list of the many features of the river. In doing so the reader imagines the river to be vibrant and colourful with an abundance of intricate subelements that give the river a sense of uniqueness and complexity. Nature is hence conveyed as beautiful in its complexity.\n\nWater motif:\n\n“wild streamlet of the West!”, “**Sink** the sweet scenes”, “thy waters rise”\n\n-          Throughout the poem there is references to water. This symbolises how the river is ever present and flows continuously. Coleridge projects a sense of endurance, indicating that nature is strong and can withstand much resistance.\n\nStructure:\n\n-          The structure of the poem is quite like a stream of consciousness, as the narrator expresses their thoughts in a loose, unrefined manner. In constructing the poem as such, Coleridge further alludes to the flow of the river, as the water streams without restraint.",

    "content": "\n# Literature Romanticism Overview\n\n#### Origins\n\nRomanticism is a movement within both art and literature throughout the 18th to 19th century. It came about as a form of revolution against the previous Neoclassical movement prevalent in Europe within the 17th to 18th centuries, which promoted a return to classical Greek and Roman artistic elements.\n\n\n\u003e [!Quote]\n\u003e **\"literature depicting emotional matter in an imaginative form\"**\n\u003e - *Friedrich Schlegel* in regards to romantic literature (from *Athenäeum-Fragment*, 1798)\n\n\n#### Prevailing principles\n\nPrimarily, romantic writers focused on the exploration of individuality, spirituality, nature, and sometimes an appreciation of isolationism as core tenants of their literature. \n\nIn terms of literary devices, personification and pathetic fallacy were heavily utilised as a byproduct of Romanticism's greater focus on nature. Karl von Martius, an early Romantic author, used such techniques in his volume report *Flora Brasiliensis*:\n\n\n\u003e [!Quote]\n\u003e **\"Even today those trees speak to me and fill my spirit with a certain pious fear,\"**\n\u003e - Karl von Martius, *Flora Brasiliensis* (1840)\n\n\n\n#### Figures of importance\n\n| Author                  | Famous Work                            |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| William Wordsworth      | \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\"         |\n| Samuel Taylor Coleridge | \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"      |\n| Percy Bysshe Shelley    | \"To a Skylark\"                         |\n| William Blake           | \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" |\n| John Keats              | \"Ode to a Nightingale\"                         |\n| Mary Shelly             | \"Frankenstein\"                                        |\n\n## References:\n- https://www.thoughtco.com/romanticism-definition-4777449#:~:text=Characteristics%20of%20Romanticism,and%20personification%20and%20pathetic%20fallacy.\n- https://uh.edu/engines/romanticism/introduction.html\n- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schlegel/#LifWor\n- https://green.harvard.edu/news/intertwining-romanticism-and-science-through-metaphor#:~:text=In%20the%20late%20eighteenth%20and,worldview%20(New%20World%20Encyclopedia).\n- https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Von_Schlegel#School_of_Romanticism\n- https://archive.org/details/athenaeum06unkngoog/page/n13/mode/2up\n- https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm#:~:text=Romanticism%2C%20first%20defined%20as%20an,and%20flourished%20until%20mid%2Dcentury.\n- https://blog.artsper.com/en/a-closer-look/an-introduction-to-romanticism/#:~:text=Romanticism%20started%20in%20Western%20Europe,the%20promotion%20of%20ideal%20values.\n- https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literary-movements/british-romanticism/authors",

  "/Metamorphosis-Marxist-Reading": {
    "title": "Metamorphosis Marxist Reading",
    "content": "\nAuthors often write to criticise the fundamental ideologies that run their societies. Franz Kafka’s *The Metamorphosis* presents the story of Gregor Samsa, who on the morning of a workday is turned into a bug and struggles to make his obligations as a travelling salesman. Through a Marxist lens my interpretation of the text is that Kafka condemns how individuals under a capitalistic society are indoctrinated into the capitalist ideal of reification. Furthermore, Kafka critiques how the capitalist superstructure makes the proletarian indebted to the bourgeoisie resulting in exploitation, and also presents the capitalist lifestyle in absurd fashion, portraying Gregor as a bug and in doing so associates capitalist greed with the unscrupulous connotations of a parasitical insect.\n\nMarxist texts are used to voice condemnations of the effect capitalism has on the worker. In contrast to my initial interpretation of The Metamorphosis as a purely absurdist text seeking to satirise the lifestyle of a working individual, a Marxist reading of the text indicates that Kafka disapproves with how reification has been engrained into the worker’s mentality. The Marxist interpret reification to be the process by which the working class are made into commodities to be exploited by the free market. In the text despite having been transformed into a large creature, Gregor instinctively worries about his job, thinking “right now I have to get up. My train leaves at five o’clock.” Through characterisation the reader perceives Gregor as indoctrinated into the capitalist mind-set of consistency and rigid, daily labour at the whim of the bourgeoisie. Upon discovering that the time was half past six, Gregor laments on how “there was no avoiding a blow up with the boss”, and that “He was the boss’s minion”. Gregor also adds that “during his five years’ service Gregor hadn’t been sick even once”. Kafka further characterises Gregor as extremely punctual, having fulfilled his obligations to the boss with an exceptionally high attendance rate. Despite this, the boss does not give Gregor a free pass, and Gregor expects to be reprimanded for a singular day of absence despite his long record of fulfilling his obligations to his boss. Kafka portrays the boss as greedy and further strips him of the human ability to forgive. The boss acts as a symbol of the bourgeoisie and thus Kafka presents the capitalists of society as mistreating their workers as commodities that they can abuse. Gregor’s acceptance of such a fate further indicates how anti-worker capitalist beliefs have been pushed onto Gregor. Hence through a Marxist lens I interpret Kafka’s text as highlighting how the working class are subject to reification by the bourgeoisie, and how they are made to accept such a fate as their only option to survive.\n\nIn contemporary society the exploitation of the worker has been counteracted by the recalcitrant attitudes of the working class. While I initially interpreted The Metamorphosis to be portraying a cynical, comedic attitude towards the standardised working lifestyle, reading the text through a Marxist lens highlights how capitalist society propagates exploitation of the worker, and that Kafka encourages working class readers to resist being exploited. A Marxist reader considers exploitation to be the material difference between the value of production for a sold good and how much a worker is paid to make said good. Gregor monologues how “Once I’ve got together the money to pay off the parents’ debt to him – that should take another five or six years… Then I’ll make the big break.” The reader is bluntly informed that Gregor merely works for his boss as he needs to pay off his parent’s debt. Kafka leads the reader to believe that Gregor does not get any personal satisfaction of enjoyment working for his boss, and only does so out of a materialistic need to survive under the provisions of the capitalist society he lives in. The reader understands that Gregor is exploited under his boss, being made to work unhealthy hours and do so with no sick days for years on end, or otherwise face being fired and having no way to pay his parent’s debts. Kafka presents Gregor as a working class individual who is enslaved by the bourgeoisie and is exploited for labour. Thus, through a Marxist lens my interpretation of Kafka’s text is that the exploitation of the proletariat is condemned.\n",

Colloids contain particles on the nanoscale that do not settle out of the mixture over time.\n    -   A homogeneous non-crystalline substance consisting of large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a second substance\n\n**4.4 Metallic Nanomaterials:**\n\n-   Consist of metal ions arranged to make structures that have **at least 1 dimension** in in the nanometre scale (1 - 100 nm)\n\n\n\nLucarelli :)\n\n8.9: Fullerenes:\n\n-   A recently discovered allotropic form of carbon.\n-   A new group of fullerenes, Carbon Nanotubes was discovered in Japan.\n-   **Fullerenes:** Three-dimensional structures formed by networks of carbon atoms.\n-   Visualise carbon nanotubes as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder shape.\n    -   Ends of CNTs are usually open or capped off using a hemispherical arrangement of carbon atoms bonded into interlocking pentagon and hexagon arrangements.\n    -   CNTs are $1\\times10^{-9}$m or 1 nanometre wide by diameter, but can be as long as several micrometres - a thousandth of a millimeter, $1 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n    -   CNTs can have an unlimited length, and can be produced with multiple walls with multiple concentric CNTs with increasing diameter being fit into one another. (**Multi Walled Nanotubes (MWNTs)**)\n    -   Atoms in CNTs are bonded through covalent bonds, giving CNTs a lot of strength/flexibility.\n    -   They are also very light as they are comprised of carbon. This creates a super-strong lightweight material.\n    -   CNTs also have weird electrical properties.\n        -   Used as semiconductors/conductors.\n        -   Can conduct 1000 times better than copper and silver.\n        -   They can conduct with little to no heating effect (radiation emitted?)\n        -   This means CNTs have a lot of potential for electrical devises.\n-   Fullerenes have a lot of surface area, and can be molecular containers. They also bond to surfaces and other structures really well.\n-   Thus, they have many applications\n-   **Nanotechnology:** A new field of scientific endeavour focused on the study and potential application of fullerenes, nanoparticles and other similar structures.\n\n8.10 Nanotechnology:\n\n-   **Nanoparticles:** Particles with at least one dimension in the 1-100 nanometre range.\n-   Nanoparticles have **unique properties** due to **quantum effects,** as a result of a **small particle size**.\n-   For example, Zinc and Titanium oxide are commonly used in sunscreen and cosmetics.\n    -   In general, they are used as **“macro particles”**. This means small particles but larger than nanoparticles.\n        -   This makes a visible white opaque layer!\n    -   Instead, using $ZnO$ and $TiO_2$ as nanoparticles allows for a **quantum effect**, as they become **invisible** while still absorbing UV.\n-   **In general,** these **quantum effects** greatly impact **optical properties.**\n    -   This is because nanoparticles, with their quantum effects, interact differently with light.\n-   However, differently sized nanoparticles also can produce unique properties.\n-   For example, Cadmium Selenide as a nanoparticle will produce different visible light when UV light is shone onto a solution containing them.\n-   These particles are known as “**quantum dots**”.\n    -   (They affect the wavelength of light, with smaller dots producing shorter wavelengths and vice versa.)\n-   CNTs also have electrical properties that differ from Carbon’s.\n-   These electrical properties make it a really good conductor and semiconductor, allowing computers to be compacted further as semiconductors are built within a nanometre’s range.\n-   Silver has many antibacterial and antifungal effects, which is further enhanced when used in **nanoparticle form.**\n    -   This is due to an increase in surface area, a common property of fullerenes.\n-   **Nanodevice research!!!** - uses in medical field, e.g. for diagnosis/detection/treatment of cancer\n-   **Dendrimers** - nanosized nanoparticle structures\n-   They can be designed as molecular carriers, which can carry molecules that recognise cancer, kill cancers, recognise a dead cancer cell, signal a cancer cell’s death, etc.\n-   Using dendrimers in this fashion, one can kill cancer cells, while reporting its efficiency.\n    -   NOTE: This would mean literally no side effects, as its only killing cancer (the bad stuff) and doesn’t work like radiation which also kills healthy cells (the good stuff)\n-   These devices are called **therapeutic nanodevices**, and use **quantum dots, nanoshells and nanopores**.\n\n8.11 Nanocomposites.\n\n-   Nanoparticles have been around for a long time, despite nanotechnology being very new.\n-   Carbon black(soot), an amorphous form of carbon is largely comprised of carbon particles in the nanometre range.\n    -   Used as an additive in rubber for tyres, as its really strong. Tyres have 25% of its rubber made of carbon black.\n    -   More amounts of carbon black will make the rubber more conductive, preventing build-ups of static electricity. - useful to prevent accidents.\n-   **Nanocomposites:** Materials created by adding nanosized particles of one material to a matrix of a bulk material (metal, polymer, ceramics(recall Pearson))\n-   Nanocomposites have numerous advantages and more useful properties:\n    -   Mechanical strength\n    -   Electrical/thermal conductivity\n    -   Optical properties\n-   Used in manufacturing of plastics - nanotubes or graphene is added.\n-   1-5% concentration of nanoparticles in nanocomposites can increase stiffness by 50%, and mechanical strength by 20%\n-   They slow down cracks from forming as they have high tensile strength.\n-   Can be used in lithium ion batteries - comprised of electrodes, which are usually made of graphite - carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets and nanocomposites have been suggested as replacements.\n    -   Carbon-silicon nanocomposite material seems to be promising\n    -   Silicon has good energy storage, but breaks down as it contracts and expands when charges are discharged.\n    -   This is where nanoparticles of carbon come in, as they can maintain a rigid structure, while still having the high energy storage of silicon.\n\n**Examples of Nanomaterials:**\n\n-   Carbon\n-   Gold\n-   Silver\n-   Zinc Oxide\n-   Cadmium selenide\n-   Titanium oxide\n-   Amorphous silica ($SiO_2$)\n-   Copper\n-   Iron\n\n**Advantages of nanomaterials: have been listed above**\n\n**Disadvantages of nanomaterials:**\n\n-   SAFETY CONCERNS:\n    -   **important rule: the properties of nanoparticles differ from the parent material in bulk form.**\n        -   e.g. glass fibre particles are very harmful, and brick workers use breathing masks to prevent exposure. In contrast, glass in bulk form is inert and harmless.\n-   Very hard to make:\n    -   **The production of nanomaterials requires a complex design and production infrastructure. There are numerous means to create nanoparticles, however they are usually very expensive and exclusive.**\n\n**WACE Study Guide Review:**\n* In general, the properties (physical + chemical) of bulk materials remains constant regardless of size.\n* However, as particle size becomes small, then properties can change drastically.\n\n- A nanoparticle is a particle that has at least 1 dimension within the nanoscale (1 - 100 nm (1 nm -\u003e $1 \\times 10^{-9}$m)).\n\n- **Nanotechnology**: \n\t- As particle size decreases, surface area greatly increases.\n\t- This means that more atoms/molecules can interact.\n\t- Reactivity is generally higher in nanoparticles due to their larger surface area, creating unique properties, that are very different in their macro particle form.\n\t- Light has a wavelength of around 500 nanometres. This means that photons are significantly larger than nanoparticles, which can exist in dimensions as small as 1 nanometre.\n\t\t- This means that light simply passes through nanomaterials, and **do not reflect**.\n\t- This is called a **quantum effect**. Essentially, due to their very small size, nanoparticles interact uniquely with particles of radiation, like light (electromagnetic).\n\t- Other forms of quantum effects exist. *Cadmium selenide* produces different types of coloured light depending on particle size while being in a solution.\n\t\t- This is different to macro particles of *Cadmium selenide*, which is insoluble and does not exhibit this range of colours.\n\t- Applications of nanotechnology include:\n\t\t- Sunscreens\n\t\t\t- Zinc oxide in its macro particle form is an effective absorber of UV light, which is why it is commonly used in sunscreens.\n\t\t\t- However, zinc oxide in its macro particle form is also a white, opaque substance.\n\t\t\t- Zinc oxide as nanoparticles becomes *transparent*, as a result of a unique **quantum effect**.\n\t\t- Special surfaces and coatings\n\t\t- Nanocomposite materials\n\t\t- Medicine\n\t- However, it is important to be aware of certain safety issues and regulations.\n\n\n[https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/science/nanotechnology/why-you-want-nanotechnology-in-your-life-198989](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/science/nanotechnology/why-you-want-nanotechnology-in-your-life-198989)\n\n[[IJSO_Bohr__Spectra_and_the_Quantum_Atom_4.pdf]]\n\n\n---\n## Recall\n",

(see [here](https://github.com/EddieTheEd/obsidiannotes-v.3-public/tree/main/.github/workflows))\n- Changed v.3 to v.4 in sidebar.\n\t- I realise I didnt put the sidebar in the notice board. This is because I was still working on it in and then i forgot.\n- Added comments!\n```html\n\u003cscript defer src=\"https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"commento\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Plans for the Future\n- No clue. When exams are over I might revamp the organisation system, and then package this alongside the other project I was working on\n- Now that I've been reminded, I'll probably flesh out the sidebar\n- I also want to integrate partytown? I know my js is a little scuffed, but I don't know about partytown's compatibility with Netlify.\n\n### Development Messages\n- STOP SPAMMING COMMENTS\n",

    "content": "# Number Sets Notes\n\nHere is a pretty good set diagram I stole from the internet:\n(for now we ignore the complex stuff, its in the next part)\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/Pasted image 20220422081915.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nThese are all the subsets for the **real** numbers\n```ad-note\n-   Real numbers: A value of a continuous quantity that can be represented as a distance on a line.\n    -   Note: continuous, as real numbers include 1 and 0.1357108375103759831...\n\n```\n\nWithin all the **real** numbers exists numerous **subsets** of numbers.\n\nThese are the definitions for all the subsets, starting from the \"smallest\":\n\n**Natural/Counting Numbers:**\n\nNumbers which are used for counting.\n\nAsk your teacher whether it starts at 0 or 1, however from those numbers they increase by 1 all the way to infinity, e.g. :\n\n$1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 \\ ... \\ \\infty$\n\nNotice that this set does not include negative numbers (or 0).\n\n```ad-note\n\nSide-Note: There are 2 accepted definitions of natural numbers:\n    -   Traditional: Natural = set of positive integers {1,2,3...}\n    -   Slightly new: Natural = set of non-negative integers {0,1,2,3...}\n```\n\nThe range of all natural numbers goes from {$1, \\infty$}\n\n(or $0, \\infty$)\n\n**Integers:**\n\nWhole numbers, **OR**\nFraction that can be simplified, so that the denominator is 1.\n\ne.g. -42/2 is an integer, as it can be simplified to -21. However, -43/2 is not an integer as it is simplified to $-21 \\ \\frac{1}{2}$, which is not whole and thus not an integer.\n\nEssentially, it's the natural numbers + all the negative whole numbers.\n\nThe range of all integers goes from {$-\\infty , \\ \\infty$}.\n\n**Rational:**\n\nA rational number is any number that can be described as a fraction of 2 whole integers.\n\nTherefore, all integers are rational (put them in a fraction, make the denominator 1)\n\nHowever, numbers such as $\\sqrt{2}$ are not rational as they cannot be expressed by a fraction.\n\n```ad-seealso\ntitle: Extension\n\nThe square root of 2 is not rational. Let’s use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational. All rational numbers can be written in the form $\\frac{p}{q}$ , where there are no common factors.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$(\\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\frac{p}{q})^2$\n\n$2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$\n\n$p^2 = 2q^2$\n\nTherefore, $p^2$ is even, as all even numbers can be written in the form $2k$, where $k$ is some number. In this case, this number is $q^2$.\n\nGiven that $p^2$ is even, then p must also be even, as an even number squared is always even, however an odd number squared is not even.\n\nHere's a slightly better proof for this relationship between numbers and their squares (but badly formatted (i dont have sadler spec book))\n\nCase 1: p is even\n\nGiven $p = 2k$, $p^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$\n\n$\\therefore p^2 = 2(2k^2)$ where in this case, the number multiplied by 2 is $2k^2$.\n\nCase 2: p is odd\n\nGiven $p = 2k-1, p^2 = (2k-1)^2 = 4k^2-4k+1$\n\n$4k^2 - 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2-2k) + 1$\n\nNow, given $2(k) + 1 = 2(k + 1) -1$,\n\n$2(2k^2-2k) +1 = 2(2k^2-2k+1) -1$\n\n$\\therefore$ $p^2$ is an odd number, following the rule $p = 2k -1$\n\nin this case, $k = 2k^2 -2k+1$\n\nNow, as $p^2$ is even, and $p$ is even, let $p = 2r$\n\nThus, our equation can be written as:\n\n$4r^2 = 2q^2$.\n\n$q^2 = 2(r^2)$\n\nThus, $q^2$ is even, where $k = r^2$.\n\nAs shown above, the square of a number’s parity (even or odd) is the same as the number’s parity. Therefore, $q$ is even.\n\nHowever, this means that both $p$ and $q$ are even, and this contradicts our initial assumption that there are no common factors between $p$ and $q$ (even numbers have the common factor of 2).\n```\n\n\nTherefore, the statement $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$ is false and thus $\\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.\nNumbers like 0.012342342134 are rational, ($\\frac{6171171067}{500000000000}$) and so are all the integers. Numbers like $\\pi$ and $e$ are not rational. (they cannot be expressed as a fraction)\n\nThus, all numbers that are **not** natural, **not** integers and **not** rational, are **real** (for now). This includes:\n-   $\\pi$\n-   $e$\n-   $\\sqrt{3}$\n-   1234.1237481237410283750134681039... (goes to infinity)\n\n**You can also call them irrational!**\n\nHere's some general notation for these sets\n\n**Notation:**\n\n| Name     | Symbol |\n| -------- | ------ |\n| Natural  | $\\mathbb{N}$ |\n| Integer  | $\\mathbb{Z}$ |\n| Rational |   $\\mathbb{Q}$   |\n| Real   |    $\\mathbb{R}$   |\n\n**Extras:**\n\n| Name              | Symbol |\n| ----------------- | ------ |\n| Irrational        |   $\\mathbb{I} \\ or \\ \\mathbb{Q}^{'}$     |\n| Complex           |   $\\mathbb{C}$    |\n| Positive Integers |    $\\mathbb{Z}^+$    |\n| Negative Integers |    $\\mathbb{Z}^{-}$    |\n| Imaginary   |   $\\mathbb{i}$     |\n",

    "content": "### Key Definitions\n- *Organic Chemistry*: The study of carbon-containing compounds (e.g. $CH_4$)\n- *Fractional Distillation*:\n\t- **Short Answer:** A type of distillation (separation technique for **miscible**(dissolve in each other) liquids), that utilises slight differences in boiling points.\n\t- **Long Answer (AKA un-edited/irrelevant)**: \n\t\t- Used when separating mixtures with similar boiling points\n\t\t- In general, the path that the boiled products take to reach the condenser is extended, or surface area is increased, usually through the use of glass beads\n\t\t- In theory (Kinetic theory of gas particles), the lower-boiling liquid will have a lot of kinetic energy, whereas the higher-boiling liquid will have less as it approaches its boiling point but does not completely reach or exceed it. The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.\n\t\t- *E.g.* if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they don’t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.\n- *Functional group*: A group of ==covalently bonded== atoms that can replace a hydrogen atom in an organic compound. These groups tend to influence the overall chemical properties of the molecule they are bonded to.\n\t- It also defines the structure of families of compounds\n- *Homologous series*: A group of compounds with a common functional group, branched or unbranched.\n\t- They may also differ by a molecular formula of $CH_2$ (e.g. $CH_4$ and $C_2H_6$ differ by $CH_2$, thus they are of the same **homologous series**)\n\t- *Structural formula*: a formula that displays the arrangement of atoms in a compound.\n\n### Key Ideas\n- *Background Information*: Covalent bonding is the electrostatic force of attraction between a shared pair of electrons *(known as a bonding pair) and the nuclei.  Atoms can share multiple pairs of electrons, up to 3 (4 does not apply, and is generally energetically unfavourable)*.\n\t- When carbon bonds with another atom, the bond is either a:\n\t\t- **Single bond**: One shared pair (indicated by a single line)\n\t\t- **Double bond**: Two shared pairs (indicated by a double line)\n\t\t- **Triple bond**: Three shared pairs (indicated by a triple line)\n- **Fractional Distillation**:\n\t- Uses marginal differences in boiling points between 2 or more miscible liquids\n\t- Uses:\n\t\t- Purification of water\n\t\t- Separation of water from ethanol\n\t\t- Crude oil refining\n\n- Hydrocarbons refer to organic compounds that contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n- Carbon atoms have a **valency of +4 (and -4)**. To obtain a stable electron configuration, carbon tends to bond covalently, and does not form ionic compounds as a result of its valency of +4. \n\t- Carbon atoms covalently bond in the following ways:\n\t\t- Forming 4 single bonds\n- Organic chemistry heavily relies on the **IUPAC naming system**. The IUPAC naming system aims to give us crucial information on the structure and properties of an organic compound.\n\t- For example, **methane**:\n\t\t- **meth**: indicates that the **largest chain** (this is important later on) of carbons only contains 1 carbon atom.\n\t\t- **ane**: indicates that the **largest bond** within the compound is a single bond.\n\t\t- For reference, this is the **structural formula** for methane:\n\t\t- ![[methane.png]]\n\t\t- Notice that there is 1 carbon in the \"largest chain\", as indicated by \"**meth**\", and that there are only single bonds, indicated by **ane**.\n\t- For reference, here are the **prefixes** that indicate the number of carbons in the **largest chain** of an organic compound:\n| Number of carbons | Prefix |\n| ----------------- | ------ |\n| 1                 | meth   |\n| 2                 | eth    |\n| 3                 | prop   |\n| 4                 | but    |\n| 5                 | pent   |\n| 6                 | hex    |\n| 7                 | hept   |\n| 8                 | oct    |\n| 9                 | non    |\n| 10                | dec       |\n- Here's another example, **ethane**:\n\t- **eth**: indicates that the **largest chain** contains **2** carbons\n\t- **ane**: indicates that the largest bond within the compound is a single bond\n\t- At this point, based on the structural formula for methane, try sketching the diagram for ethane.\n\t- Did you get this?\n\t- ![[index 1.png]]\n```ad-question\nTry drawing the rest of these hydrocarbons (e.g. propane, butane, etc.)\n```\n- Here are the **suffixes** and **homologous series** name for the largest bond in an organic compound:\n| Type of bond | Suffix | Homologous series |\n| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |\n| Single bond  | ane    | Alkanes          |\n| Double bond  | ene    | Alkenes          |\n| Triple bond  | yne    | Alkynes          | \n- Double and triple bonds are special due to the presence of **isomers**, which will be covered later.\n\nhah you want me to actually finish this? \n\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n## Worked Answers\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Class Notes (Yr 10)\n\nCarbon has a valency in 4 (4 number of electrons in valence shell, thus it needs an additional 4 to get a full shell of 8)\n\nHydrocarbons are in a group called alkanes.\n\nif there is a bond that is greater than 2, it is unsaturated",

In comparison to Earth, the moon has less mass than the Earth. Thus, your weight on the moon is a lot less in comparison to when on the Earth as there is less gravitational effect on your gravity.\nQ2. Due to inertia, objects will remain in motion unless an outer force acts upon them. Thus, when the bus stops the passengers inside are still going in a forwards motion. This causes them to move forwards until the force is balanced.\nQ3. According to Newton's 1st Law of Motion, stationary objects remain stationary unless an external unbalanced force acts upon them. In this scenario, although the car is accelerating, I am still a stationary object, until the car's motion acts upon me. This causes me to appear to move backwards, however I am gaining momentum as my motion balances with the cars motion, from a point of stationary movement to an equal motion inline with the car.\nQ4. 1.

One of those is sending a timestamp to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. This podcast was recorded at...\n\nTAMARA KEITH, HOST:\n\n2:08 p.m. on Monday, March 28.\n\nAYELET: Things may have changed by the time you hear this, but hopefully I will be one step closer to accomplishing my birthday goal. Enjoy the show.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE BIGTOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\")\n\nKEITH: We got you. Now just 39 more things to do.\n\nDEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: That's ambitious.\n\nKEITH: I hope some of them are easier. Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\n\nWALSH: I'm Deirdre Walsh. I cover Congress.\n\nKEITH: And we are checking in on the state of the COVID pandemic in the U.S. today, so we have Allison Aubrey here from NPR's health team. Hey, Allison.\n\nALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Hey, Tamara. Hey, Deirdre. Good to be here.\n\nKEITH: So we've got a little bit of politics, a little bit of science, and we are glad to have you joining us for it. Let's start with just the state of things. COVID cases, hospitalizations and, finally, deaths are down in the United States right now. But Dr. Anthony Fauci said last week that it is too early to declare victory over the virus.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nANTHONY FAUCI: This virus has fooled us before, and we really must be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant. And we don't want to be caught flat-footed on that.\n\nKEITH: So, Allison, what's he talking about there?\n\nAUBREY: I think he's looking across the Atlantic. He sees a surge in the U.K. and in other European countries. And throughout the pandemic, the U.S. has typically tended to trail the U.K. by two or three weeks. You know, cases are so low right now compared to winter, but there has been a plateauing in the decline, so a slowing in the rate of decline. And this is happening at the very time that the very contagious omicron subvariant BA.2 has gained some traction. So there is some concern, but big picture, people in the U.S. are much better protected given the combo of vaccines, immunity from natural infection and medicines to treat than anybody was a year and a half ago.\n\nWALSH: So, Allison, the federal government and the states have really done away with the COVID precautions that were in place for the omicron surge, things like mask mandates, vaccine requirements. So given that and what you just said about, you know, cases overseas, how prepared is the United States for another surge?\n\nAUBREY: I think it depends on what happens in the next several months. Will Congress and the White House work out how to pay for vaccines and medicines going forward for COVID? Another factor is how good is the U.S. surveillance system going to be to spot potential new, troublesome variants if they're - if they come around? You know, there's been a big effort to improve wastewater surveillance, to serve as a kind of early warning system for an outbreak. And this is a kind of passive surveillance that becomes really important come fall, when, say, people are no longer doing routine COVID testing. Everyone will still be going to the bathroom every day, and wastewater is a very good way to track how much virus is circulating. So the administration says the wastewater surveillance system needs to be funded.\n\nKEITH: Deirdre, when we talk about the federal funding, that does remain a great big question mark. The White House has been asking for more money. Congress passed this big budget bill that was like a freight train that you couldn't slow down, but the COVID money was thrown off - overboard.\n\nWALSH: It was. I mean, there was a bipartisan deal with the House and the Senate and the White House to include a little bit more than $15 billion in that broader spending bill that also had money for Ukraine and earmarks for members of Congress. But at the last minute, a group of House Democrats cried foul because part of the deal Democrats made with Republicans is that they were going to pay for the new spending, and they were, you know, offsetting it or they were paying for this new spending bill, clawing back some of the unspent COVID money that was going to the states. And a bunch of members from those states who hadn't, you know, spent the money but had plans for it, had budgeted things that they were already planning to do with the money, said they wouldn't vote for the bill. And they literally didn't have the votes to pass it. So now there are negotiations going on mostly on the Senate side to try to come up with a bipartisan deal that can get 60 votes in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been working with Utah Republican Mitt Romney, so we're looking at probably something a little less than that was in that broader deal. And we'll see possibly maybe this week if they can get a deal together.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. And we should say that there's been something of a back and forth over the last couple of weeks with members of Congress, especially Romney's been very vocal, saying we need to know more about how this money has been spent, all of the money, and the White House saying we've given it to you. And then last week, there was a briefing where the head of the COVID response, Jeff Zients, at the White House, like, literally held up a binder, right, Allison?\n\nAUBREY: That's right. He said, look, I've got 385 pages of documents and tables, and we have accounted for all of the money that has been appropriated for COVID. He basically says we're kind of headed into a funding emergency if Congress doesn't act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEFF ZIENTS: Time is of the essence, as we heard across the briefing today. With every day that passes, we risk not having the tools we need to fight COVID.\n\nWALSH: I think the other thing that happened since this bipartisan deal sort of fell apart is there's been some reporting on some, you know, what you would call misuse of COVID funds. The Associated Press did a story about sort of some of the money going to, you know, programs that really don't have a lot - a direct link to COVID. So Republicans who were already raising questions are pointing to that report and saying that the tables that the administration showed them in terms of where all the money has gone so far, included some of the big federal agencies like HHS but didn't include some of the other agencies that also had COVID spending programs. So I think they're just sort of, you know, continuing to throw more asks onto the list for the administration before they're ready to support another bill.\n\nKEITH: Allison, I want to circle around to an important question, which is what happens if this money doesn't come through or what is being lost? What is the effect of the White House not getting the money that they're asking for? Is is there a real-world effect?\n\nAUBREY: Right now, I think the effect is a bit theoretical because it's unclear how much money will come through when. So I visited a federally qualified health clinic last week in Alexandria, Va. I interviewed the medical director. He said, yes, we're quite concerned. Any time you talk about curbing funding, look, we've been able to vaccinate people because of direct government funding of the vaccination program. We have medicines here that we can deliver to our patients because of the direct funding from the federal government. I don't know how I would buy these medicines if we weren't getting direct funding. But at the same time, he acknowledged that they have multiple streams of funding coming in, and it's not clear which ones might be at risk of being cut off. The secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, also weighed in on this last week at the White House. He basically said, look, we'll have to just keep moving money around to keep COVID prevention and treatments going if Congress doesn't act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nXAVIER BECERRA: We'll exhaust every dollar that we have. We'll use every dollar that we can - that is flexibly available to continue to provide for the need.\n\nAUBREY: Ultimately, he said, they'd have to look for other ways to pay if Congress doesn't authorize more funding; he said maybe moving towards allowing Americans to purchase, you know, vaccines or treatments through other means.\n\nKEITH: All right. We're going to take a quick break. And when we get back, another round of COVID boosters?\n\nAnd we're back. And the FDA is expected to approve another booster dose, another vaccine dose for people aged 50 and over this week. Allison, what's the thinking behind that?\n\nAUBREY: Well, the reasoning is that immunity does diminish some over time. I mean, the protection against serious illness and death holds up, but particularly in older people and those who are immune compromised, prior studies have shown that boosters help shore up protection. Now, there's not a lot of data yet on how much protection or how long protection would hold up from a fourth dose. Another question is what kind of booster may be best - one that combines protection against multiple variants, an omicron-specific booster or something different. So what we can look for this week might be the beginning of the process. It might be an authorization that it's OK to give a fourth dose. But I do think that there are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.\n\nKEITH: All right. Well, because this is the POLITICS PODCAST, I do want to get back to the politics, too, which is that COVID was obviously dominant in the 2020 election. We are now headed into these 2022 midterms. Deirdre, are people running for office even talking about COVID? Is this on the radar?\n\nWALSH: It is, but it's in a different way than it was in 2020. I think a lot of lawmakers, and they say a lot of their constituents, are moving on from the pandemic. I mean, at least on Capitol Hill, you know, they lifted the mask mandate. The tours - the public tours are starting back up this week. But there are a lot of issues from the pandemic that are still hanging over the 2022 midterms - issues like the impact that the pandemic had on education, issues about parents' rights, parents' concerns about the pandemic on their kids. I think there is still a lot of, you know, political debate about how lawmakers and states and governors handled the pandemic and how they potentially didn't respond to the concerns that parents raised. That's a big issue that I expect to hear a lot about. And I also think inflation because of, you know, supply chain issues related to the pandemic is probably the driving factor in the midterms. So it may not be sort of phrased the same way that it was in the 2020 election, but it - the pandemic is leading to driving debate about the sort of key issues that a lot of lawmakers are going to be talking about and running ads on right up until November.\n\nKEITH: Right - because the pandemic was this huge disruptive thing that is continuing, to this day, to be hugely disruptive in various ways in the fabric of society and also in the - you know, literally in the supply chains.\n\nWALSH: Right. And I think a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill are really looking to the White House to try to - I mean, they know this is going to be a referendum on the Biden presidency. So, Tam, like, what are they saying about what the messaging from there is going to be going into the midterms?\n\nKEITH: Well, they are definitely not in a mission accomplished, spike the football mode, but they are certainly trying to move the pandemic to a place where it is - you know, it's the background music. It is not the dominant thing that they are talking about or working about - not the dominant thing that the White House is talking about as it was earlier in the administration, even as, right now, the press secretary and deputy press secretary both have COVID. So, you know, it continues to be a thing that rears its head in ways that it will because it is a contagious virus. But the White House is moving to this place where they are saying, look, all of the tools are available, especially if Congress comes through with the funding. But, you know, there's medications. There's testing. There's at-home testing - all of these tools available. The White House is going to put them all in one place so that they are easy to access and easy to find. And the message from the CDC is, you know, look it up. See what the level of COVID spread is in your region, and make your decisions based on that, whether to wear a mask or not. The idea is that they have, in theory - and, Allison, I'd be curious what you think of this - but that they've sort of set up a structure that can dial up and dial down based on the threat level.\n\nAUBREY: Yeah. I think that was really clear the last time they, you know, finally said, OK, we are no longer recommending sort of universal masking. You can - kids can take, you know, masks off at schools. It was very clear then kind of, like - there's an old expression that all public health is local. And now the CDC is saying, all right. We're giving you a way to - we're giving you all the information you need. Now you need to figure out how to act on the information. If cases go up, here's your tools to add protection back in. If cases go down, dial them back down.\n\nKEITH: All right. Well, we are going to leave it there for now. Allison Aubrey, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nAUBREY: It was great to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nKEITH: I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\n\nWALSH: I'm Deirdre Walsh. I cover Congress.\n\nKEITH: And thank you for listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE BIGTOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# References\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/transcripts/1089315461",

E.g. in period 2, the valence electrons are on the n = 2 shells.\n\nGroups have the same valence electron number, and this will dictate their chemical properties / the ways they bond.\n\nNote: They are **similar** but not the same. Some are more/less reactive than others.\n\nMost elements will try to reach stability of **nearest noble gas**. \n\nE.g. Potassium has an electronic configuration of $2,8,8,1$, it will achieve stability by losing electrons to have the electron configuration of its nearest noble gas (Argon). \n\nAs you go lower on a group, elements get more reactive.\n\nThis is because attraction to nucleus is lower as the number of shells increase (and the distance from the energy levels and nucleus increases).\n\nTo become an ion you require ionisation energy.\n\nIonisation energy is needed to break the attraction between an electron and its nucleus, so the further away an electron is from its nucleus the weaker the attraction force, and thus less ionisation energy is required to ionise.\n\nThus, elements in higher periods are more reactive.\n\nTherefore, elements in higher periods have lower ionisation energy.\n\n**Non-metals typically gain electrons.**\n\nTypical behaviour of group 7 (non-metals) is to gain electrons.\n\n**Check for diatomic molecules!!**\n\ne.g.\n\n$Cl_{2}+ 2\\bar e \\rightarrow 2Cl^-$\n\nWhat is charge of nitride\n\nNitrogen has an electron configuration of $2,5$.

This is due to a stronger electrostatic attraction between ions of metals and the sea of delocalised electrons in a network.\n\n* Liquid metals also conduct electricity, so liquid metals still have a sea of delocalised electrons.\n\n**Melting point**\n* Why do some metals have high melting points, and why do other have lower ones?\n* Aluminium has a significantly higher melting point.\n* Aluminium's electronic configuration: $2,8,3$.\n\t* Thus, each atom of aluminium has 3 electrons it can **delocalise**.\n* Therefore, in a diagram, cations have a charge of 3+, and there are more electrons than sodium. \n* Thus, there is a stronger electrostatic attraction between cations and the sea of delocalised electrons.\n* This logic follows for density. - **Low charge = low density**\n\n**Electrical conductivity**:\n* In metals, **electrons** conduct electricity. **Specifically, the delocalised ones**(because they are mobile).\n* Gasses on its own are not electrically conductive.\n\n**Malleability**:\n* The ability for metal to be bent into shapes\n* If you apply force in a metallic network, you **do not** break the structure.\n* The sea of delocalised electrons are **non-directional**. Thus, when you apply force cations slide around in a sea of delocalised electrons.\n* The structure does not break, as the structure is **rigid**.\n\n**Ductility**:\n* Quality of metals that allows metals to be pulled into wires.\n* When producing a wire, the cations just move into a linear shape, surrounded by the sea of delocalised electrons in a network.\n\n**Ionic Bonding**:\n* If a compound has a metal and a non-metal, it is ionic.\n* Typical behaviour: solid at room temperature.\n\n* Noble gases are chemically stable because they have full outer shells of electrons.\n* s-block elements lose one or more electrons to form stable cations (positively charged ions).\n* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.\n* p-block elements gain one or more electrons to form stable anions (negatively charged ions).\n* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.\n\nyea ms pilling is the kind of teacher to teach an entire chem topic in a single lesson\n\nNote: **Most metals are found on the left side. As discussed previously in the Periodicity section, elements on the left have a lower ionisation(first + others) energy. This is essential as there must be little energy required to ionise metal atoms to produce cations and a sea of delocalised electrons**",

THis process involves breaking the bonds/attraction in these individual substances, which is **endothermic**, so requires energy.\n\nIn the solution, attractions form between the solvent and solute, and this bond formation is **exothermic**, releasing energy.\n\nWhether the solution forms overall depends on  the overall process requires too much energy to be **favourable**.\n\nWe want more energy to be released, then energy to be consumed, for a substance to be dissolved and thus create a solution.\n\n**Water - the universal solvent**\n- As a highly polar molecule, water is great at dissolving polar molecular substances and many ionic substances.\n\n- Water can form a range of intermolecular forces to stabilise an solution:\n\n**Ion-dipole forces:**\n* Ion-dipole forces form between ions of an ionic compound and molecules of water. We say the ions are hydrated.\n- If the ion-dipole forces formed between ions and water are strong enough, they can pull ions off the surface of an ionic lattice, and the ionic substance is soluble.\n- Not all ionic substances dissolve. In insoluble substances, the ionic bonding is too strong, and the ion-dipole bonds formed are not strong enough to beak up the ionic lattice.\n\n**Solubility of ionic substances**\nAll ionic substances are soluble to some extent, so we categorise substances by the concentration of a saturated solution at 25 degrees celcius.\n\n* A substance is soluble if a saturated solution is 0.1 mol L-1 or higher.\n* A substance is described as slightly soluble if a saturated solution is 0.01 mol L-1 to 0.1 mol L-1\n* A substance is described as insoluble if a saturated solution is below 0.01 mol L-1\n\n* In most insoluble substances, the rate of reaction for ions to both be displaced and reform the ionic lattice is equal (without solvent). This leads to an equilibrium. When water is added, the rate of reaction for ions to become displaced increases. However, this increase is marginal. In theory, if you add enough solvent the substance will dissolve.\n",

If you find a solvent which dissolves one but not the other, you can add it to the solids, the one that dissolves will create a solution - note this is called filtrate - and the one that does not will stay solid. Then you can use filtration methods and then crystalize the solid in the solution.\n\nNote - research physical properties",

Compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (**adsorbed**) and slowed down. Either a solid or a liquid.\n\nMobile phase:\n- The phase that moves. The more soluble compounds in the mixture are carried faster as the mobile phase moves. Either a liquid or a gas.\n\nPaper chromatography:\n- Is used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments.\n- We put the mixture on a **line of origin**\n- Note that we do not place the line of origin within the solvent, as the mixture would simply dissolve in the solvent and not move up the stationary phase.\n- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture.\n- The solvent is drawn up the paper by **capillary action**.\n- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the mixture's pattern.\n\nThin layer chromatography:\n- All chromatography involves a stationary and mobile phase.\n- In TLC, the stationary phase is a layer of silica gel fixed onto a glass plate.\n- The mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substances.\n- Has the same principles as paper chromatography.\n- TLC involves a stable silica gel, but paper in paper chromatography is flexible and might affect results of chromatography. In TLC, the glass plate does not bend, and thus you will have better results.\n- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix; however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix.\n- A dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and caries it up the matrix with it.\n- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to he silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent\n- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.\n",

This is because there is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid.\n\n**Chromatography:**\n- An *analytical* technique\n- Graphite does not dissolve in aqueous or organic solvents. Therefore, we use graphite as the material of our line of origin in paper chromatography.\n- Do not add any extra variables, time between chromatograms should be constant.\n- 2 Principles:\n\t- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix, however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix.\n\t- A dry sample is played in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it.\n- Many substances are white or colourless, and so aren't visible on a TLC plate.\n- One way of making colourless substances show up is to use UV light.\n- This usually works well for organic compounds.\n- A chemical locating agent can be used.\n- Ninhydrin is a common one. When reacted with an organic compound, it stains it purple-brown.\n- The solvent is drawn up the stationary phase by capillary action.\n\t- Adhesive force are between molecule of different substance. Adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to stationary phase.\n\t- Cohesive forces are between molecules of the same substances. Cohesion enables solvent molecules to bond each other, and move each other through stationary phase.\n\n**The most crucial information to year 11 chemistry**\n- When you stay quiet, zombie cannot see you\n- When you have a terminal illness, zombie cannot see you because you are not a good host\n- How did Jerusalem got sieged by zombies\n\t- Jerusalem people started singing\n\t- Zombie was like \"hang on a minute what's happening\" - actual quote from Ms Pilling\n\t- Zombie started building a zombie ladder\n\t- One by one they got to the top of the wall\n\t- Story is that zombies infected Jerusalem.\n\t- Ukrainian plane die before reaching Ukraine\n- Attraction of zombie to all is called adhesive forces\n\t- The force is between different types of things: Zombie and wall\n\t- Cohesive force is the attraction between zombies\n\nThis was indeed said by Ms Pilling.\n\n**Capillary action:**\n- The mobile phase (solvent) is drawn up the stationary phase by capillary action.\n- **Adhesive forces** are between molecules of different substances. Adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to the stationary phase.\n- **Cohesive forces** are between molecules of the same substance.\n\n\n**TLC Advantages**:\n* The glass plate is rigid, not flexible like paper, so it is easy to control.\n* After separation, the substances in the mixture can be recovered. The silica gel holding the separated substance is scraped off the glass plate and added to a solvent. The substance will dissolve and the silica gel can easily be removed by filtration. The glass plates can be recoated with silica gel and used over and over again.\n",

Place filtered paper in a funnel. Place this funnel above a flask.\n2.  Pour the mixture into the funnel.\n\n-   Use of separating funnel (D)\n    \n    -   Uses differences in density\n    -   Involves 2 liquid that form a heterogenous mixture.\n    \n-   Distillation - based on different boiling points (D)\n    \n    -   Water - 100 degrees celcius\n    -   Ethanol - 76-78 degrees celcius\n    -   label **condenser**\n    -   Distillation refers to the process of converting a liquid into a gaseous state, and then back into a liquid.\n    -   Used to separate 2 or more liquids with different boiling points.\n    -   Vapour is collected and condensed using a condenser.\n    \n-   Distillation apparatus\n    \n-   Fractional distillation (D) - not overly complex diagram e.g. for crude oil\n    \n    -   Used when separating mixtures with similar boiling points\n    -   In general, the path that the boiled products take to reach the condenser is extended, or surface area is increased, usually through the use of glass beads\n    -   In theory (Kinetic theory of gas particles), the lower-boiling liquid will have a lot of kinetic energy, whereas the higher-boiling liquid will have less as it approaches its boiling point but does not completely reach or exceed it. The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.\n    -   This increases the purity of the condensed product.\n    -   E.g. if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they don’t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.\n-   Crystallization\n    \n-   Electrostatic attraction\n    \n    -   Repulsion/attraction due to charged particles\n-   Magnetic susceptibility\n    \n    -   Metals reacting with a magnetic field (magnet)\n-   Vaporisation\n    \n    -   If the substance you are looking for decomposes at high temperatures, dont use\n    -   e.g. Ammonium Nitrate\n-   Decanting\n    \n-   Sieving\n    \n\n(D) = need to know how to draw diagram\n\n### Separating Mixtures:\n\n-   Mixtures can be separated by any means that makes use of the different physical properties of its constituents.\n-   The properties of the components of a mixture determine the best separation method\n",

If ideal gas, this is elastic.\n\nAnything that increases the number of successful collisions will speed up a reaction. \n**How to speed up reaction?**\n- Increase temperature - this is usually costly, but it will increase rate. This is economically/environmentally unfavourable. \n\t- Velocity of particles increases, therefore particles collide more frequently, and thus more successful reactions occur. \n- Add catalyst - this reduces activation energy, and thus more particles will have the required energy to collide successfully, resulting in more success collisions and thus rate of reaction increases\n\t- This is the best solution!! :)\n- Increase concentration\n\t- If volume is constant, but more gas is injected, pressure increases. Furthermore, as there are more particles, more particles will collide at a greater frequency.

Change in PH levels - using PH meter\n\nor indicators\n\n## How do we separate things?\n\n### Physical Means:\n\n-   Filtration (Gravity filtration)\n    -   used to separate heterogeneous mixtures composed of solids and liquids\n    -   Uses a porous barrier to separate the solid from the liquid\n    -   Smaller particles of liquid passes through leaving the solid in the filter paper.\n    -   **Need to be able to draw a diagram**\n-   Chromatography\n-   Centrifuging - separate plasma from blood\n-   Evaporating - similar to distillation, you evaporate solvent completely until dryness\n    -   Evaporation can be used to separate a solute from the solvent in a solution.\n    -   evaporating basin\n-   Crystallization - if solution is not thermally stable\n    -   Separation technique that results in the formation of pure solid particles from a solution containing the dissolved substance\n    -   As one substance evaporates, the dissolved substance comes out of solution and collects as crystals\n    -   Produces highly pure solids\n    -   Rocky candy is an example of this\n    -   Advantage: you will always form a pure substance, not always the case with evaporation.\n-   Dissolving\n-   Decantation\n    -   Decanting is done to separate particulates from a liquid by allowing the solids to settle to the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle-free part of the liquid. Another method is to allow two immiscible liquids to separate and the lighter liquid is poured off.\n-   Sieving\n    -   a porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes.\n    -   method is most commonly used to effect gross separations, as of liquids from suspended crystals or other solids\n    -   to accelerate filtration, pressure usually is applied\n    -   a series of sieves is attached, with the screen of largest hole size at the top.\n-   Flotation\n-   Distillation\n    -   used to separate homogenous mixtures\n    -   based on difference in boiling points of substances involved\n    -   **Be able to draw a distillation apparatus**\n\nSlightly soluble = soluble\n\n-   NaCl and CuCl_2 are both soluble in water, so using water to dissolve one but not the other doesn’t work. However, in Ethanol, as NaCl has a strong ionic bond, ethanol isn’t polar enough (dipole). So NaCl will not dissolve and CuCl_2 will.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n-   **Solution:** A mixture in which the solute particles are homogenously distributed throughout particles of solvent\n    \n    -   Can be solid (e.g. Bronze(Metal alloys)), liquid (e.g. Sea water) or gas (e.g. Air)\n-   **Aqueous Solution:** Liquid solution where the solvent is water\n    \n-   **Solvent:** The major component of a solution by mass\n    \n-   **Solute:** The minor components of a solution by mass\n    \n-   **Dissolving:** Solid particles are separated and distributed throughout the mixture, increasing solution concentration.\n    \n-   **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n-   **Saturated:** Contain the same amount of solute that the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n    -   Rate of dissolving and crystallization are equal\n-   **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n    -   Can be achieved through heating and dissolving, then carefully cooling the solution.\n\nSolubility curves.\n\n**Solubility is measured in how many grams of solute dissolves in 100 mL.**",

By axiom 1, each of these pairs intersects in at most 1 point. Hence there are at most three points where 3 straight lines can intersect.\n\n*Theorems build upon other theorems; proof of new theorems rarely refer directly to axioms. It's like a brick tower where the foundation is the axioms and the walls are the theorems. You can trace a theorem from the top to the axioms that help prove it.*\n\n",

In particular a line segment is a set of infinitely many points. This line segment  can have properties that are similar to others, but unless it has the exact same infinite many points, they are not equal.\n\nAre $\\vec{AB}$ and $\\vec{DC}$ the same vector or different vectors?\n\nThey are **the same**.\n\nVectors can be thought of as properties of line segments.\n\nIf two segments have length 6, the same number 6 is used to describe their lengths.\n\nLikewise, the same vector is used to describe the magnitude and direction of two segments with the same magnitude and direction.\n\n- How does this relate to position vectors?\n- In this case, the vectors **don't have a fixed location**, although the line segments being described do.\n- Hence, position vectors with the same magnitude and direction are equivalent as position has no effect on the vector\n\t- Vectors are abstract quantities\n\t- Vectors have **no location**\n\t- Must distinguish between the place where a vector is drawn and its actual properties as a vector.\n\n### Addition of vectors in geometry:\n\n$\\overrightarrow{PQ}+\\overrightarrow{QR} = \\overrightarrow{PR}$\n\nWhen we add arrows with this two letter notation, notice how the Q is the rightmost for the first, and leftmost for the second.

We think of a vector as having two components: magnitude and direction. When we notate a vector, such as $\\overrightarrow{0}$. Yet, 0 is simply a magnitude value. Hence, they are different. (Although the direction component is empty, the fact that the vector still has a container is enough to distinguish it from 0.)\n\n",

An angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.\n- Prove that $\\angle AOC = 2 \\times \\angle ABC$\n\n![](000_Files/000a_images/theorem%201.png)\n\n- Let $x\\degree + y\\degree = \\angle ABC$\n- The line made by $OB$ gives a triangle of $OBC$, and of $OBA$.\n- $OA = OB$ (radii)\n- $\\therefore \\triangle AOB$ is isosceles , $\\triangle COB$ is isosceles\n- $\\angle OAB = \\angle OBA = x \\degree$ ($\\triangle AOB$ is isosceles)\n- $\\angle OAC = \\angle OCA = y \\degree$\n\n**Theorem:**\n- In a triangle, an exterior angle is the sum of the 2 **remote** interior angles.\n\n- $\\angle AOD = 2\\times x \\degree$ (exterior angle is sum of remote interior angles)\n- $\\angle COD = 2 \\times y\\degree$ (exterior angle is sum of remote interior angles)\n- $\\angle AOD + \\angle COD = 2\\times x\\degree + 2 \\times y \\degree = 2(x\\degree + y\\degree) = 2(\\angle ABC)$, as required\n\n2.

Angles in the same segment are equal.\n\n- This is essentially using the first theorem for multiple angle on the circumference, because they all **subtend the same arc!**\n\n4.

Because this forms the basis of our calculations, i.e. where we've stopped is where we've assumed stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of acid/base have been added to neutralise.\n\nThis yields pH curves.\n\nThe endpoint, in comparison, is when a colour change occurs. In general, the equivalence point will **never** be the same as the endpoint! Our calculations will always be incorrect! \n- The endpoint is when we stop titration - we stop at the **first permanent colour change of indicator!**\n\nHence, we want to choose an indicator that will produce an endpoint closest to the equivalence point, so using an acidic(don't take that literally, i mean turns in acid conditions) indicator for a titration with an acidic equivalence point is better than using a basic indicator.\n\nReconsider this system: \n$2HCl + Na_{2}CO_{3} \\to H_{2}O+CO_{2}+2NaCl$\n\nSince it is acidic, phenolphthalein is a **horrible indicator!!!!** It changes colour when its basic, and a basic pH is no where near the actual pH when equivalence is reached! \u003e:(\n\nInstead, we use methyl orange (as it changes around pH 4, which is slightly(by slightly i mean 1000 times more acidic than water) acidic).\n\n## Indicator choice\n- Correct indicator choice means equivalence and end point are close (1 drop, due to how *steep the curve is*)\n- Strong acid + strong base, either acidic or basic indicator works (cause once again, pH curve so god damn steeeeeeep)\n- Strong acid + weak base, eg. $HCl/Na_{2}CO_{3}$, resultant is a weak acid, hence an acidic indicator good, basic indicator **bad**!\n- Strong base, weak acid, e.g. $NaOH/CH_{3}COOH$, resultant is a weak base, hence a basic indicator good, acidic indicator **bad**!\n- Weak acid, weak base: **THIS IS BAD! BUFFER FORMS, SO PH CURVE VERY STEEP, NO POINT TITRATING THIS!**\n\t- This is why we sometimes need to do multiple titrations for some things, e.g. say we have $Na_{2}CO_{3}$ as our primary standard, and we want to find the concentration of $CH_{3}COOH$. Then, we would have to do something similar to the following:\n\t\t- Standardise $HCl$ using *primary standard* (weak base to strong acid)\n\t\t- Standardise $NaOH$ using $HCl$ (strong acid to strong base)\n\t\t- Use the standardised $NaOH$ to titrate $CH_{3}COOH$(finally, we use our resultant i)\n\n- Remember from the \"main characters\"(ah yes naming convention 101) that the best basic indicator is **phenolphthalein**, the best acidic indicator is **methyl orange**!\n\n## TLDR\nYou can use 4 sig figs for additional accuracy! e.g. 26.65 vs 26.6\n\n## Tricksy\nIf they ask like \"what if x was done incorrectly\", it usually means the volume measured is changed due to number of moles of something changes. use that, alongside the $c=\\frac{n}{V}$, to determine difference between calculated and real value.\n\nThey can use choice of indicator for this as well. \n\n",

Thus the concentration of reagents falls. \n\nAs the reverse rate is slower than the forward rate, the system consumes less products than it produces, hence the concentration of products rises.\n\nAs a result of the changing concentrations, the forward rate will partially decrease as the concentration of reagents fall, and the reverse rate will partially increase as the concentration of products rises.\n\nThis occurs until the rates are equal, and equilibrium is thus re-established having shifted right.\n\n### Things to consider\n- Both reaction rates are faster than they were at the previous equilibrium.\n- When doing questions, distinguish between what happens \"at the time of change\", and \"when equilibrium is re-established\".\n\t- At the time of change refers to the initial change. i.e. when we increase the concentration of a reagent, what is the initial change\n\t\t- Forward reaction rate is increased\n\t\t- Reverse reaction rate is unaffected\n\t- When equilibrium is re-established refers to after the initial change. Say the initial change was an increase in the concentration of the reagent.\n\t\t- Both reverse and forward reaction rates are higher than at the initial equilibrium\n\t\t- $[H^+]$ is lower than it was when more was added, but higher than it was at the initial equilibrium.\n\t\t- $[CrO_{4}^{2-}]$ is lower than at the initial equilibrium\n\t\t- $[Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}]$ is higher than at the initial equilibrium\n\t\t\t- **Note:** the difference in concentrations from initial to final is **proportional** to the *molar ratio* of the equation. ***This should be shown on your graph!***\n\n## Review: Equilibrium Constant\n- Note: $K_{c}$ only changes when temperature changes, otherwise it is constant!\n\nRecall the equilibrium system $2CrO_{4(aq)}^{2-}+2H^{+}_{(aq)}\\rightleftharpoons Cr_{2}O_{7(aq)}^{2-}+H_{2}O_{(l)}$\n\nHence,\n$K_{c} = \\frac{[Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}]}{[CrO_{4}^{2-}]^2[H^{+}]^2}$\n\n\n## Le Chatelier's Principle\n\nIf we increase $[H^+]$ the forward reaction is favoured to oppose the change(consume $[H^+]$). This causes an increase in products, **equilibrium position shifts right**.\n\n- $[H^+]$ is still greater than before - *partially* counteracted.\n\n## Decreasing Concentrations\n\nRecall the equilibrium system $2CrO_{4(aq)}^{2-}+2H^{+}_{(aq)}\\rightleftharpoons Cr_{2}O_{7(aq)}^{2-}+H_{2}O_{(l)}$\n\n- Add $OH^-$ - This will reduce $[H^+]$.\n\n### Initial Change\n- Concentration of reagents falls\n- Concentration of products is unchanged\n\nIt follows that:\n- Forward rate decreases\n- Reverse rate is unchanged\n\n### Use Le Chatelier's Principle\n- A decrease in $[H^+]$ causes the reverse reaction to be favoured (produce more $H^+$)\n- This causes an increase in reactants, and equilibrium position shifts left.\n\n### Final Change\n- Both rates of reaction are lower than at the initial equilibrium\n- $[H^+]$ increases but not to its previous level\n- $[CrO_{4}^{2-}]$ increases by the same amount as $[H^+]$\n- $[Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}]$ is decreased by half the amount of $[H^+]$\n\t- Note the specific amount is based on the molar ratios.\n\n### Dilution\nWhen we dilute an aqueous system, the concentration of all products are decreased.\n\n### Initial Change\n- Forward and reverse rates are decreased.\n\nRecall the equilibrium system $2CrO_{4(aq)}^{2-}+2H^{+}_{(aq)}\\rightleftharpoons Cr_{2}O_{7(aq)}^{2-}+H_{2}O_{(l)}$\n\nThere must be a winner, cause of course there must.\n\nHence, one of the reactions will slow down more and one will slow down less. This is the **favoured reaction**(slows down less).\n\n### Le Chatelier's Principle\n\nOverall ion concentration is decreased. The reverse reaction produces more moles compared to the forward reaction(4-1). Hence the reverse reaction is favoured so more ions are produced, and thus partially counteracting the decreased overall ion concentration.\n\n#### Why does this happen?\n- The forward reaction required the collision of 4 different ions\n- The reverse reaction requires the collision of 2 different species.\n\n- Hence, when the concentration of everything is decreased, the forward reaction is much more impacted by the dilution as it is even harder to have the 4 ions collide. \n\n## Important Note\n- I will be referring to Le Chatelier's Principle as Le Shat from now on. Both because it is easier and it is funny.\n\n- We **usually** say partially counteract, but we **must say only counteract** for special cases. i.e. decomposition of $CaCO_{3}$.\n\n\n",

Hence this change will be counteracted by reducing the temperature, thus the endothermic forward reaction will be favoured as it absorbs energy, reducing the temperature. Hence we will observe the system become more brown as more NO2 is produced. \n\n## When temperature increases\n- Both reaction rates increase.\n- The higher $E_{a}$ of the forward (endothermic) reaction means that this reaction is affected more by changes in temperature, i.e. it is more sensitive. \n\t- Explanation: Maxwell-Boltzmann diagram\n\t\t- Proportional increase of particles now able to undergo forward reaction compared to the increase for the reverse reaction is significantly more, hence the rate of the forward reaction increases over the reverse reaction rate.\n\t\t- e.g for reverse, number of particles is doubled, but for forward, number of particles is **8 times more**!\n\t\t- TLDR proportionally more particles will gain $E_{a}$ or better for the endothermic reaction\n\nThis results in the **endothermic** reaction rates increasing more, hence this reaction is the one that is favoured.\n\nSee two graphs: Rate and concentration\n- Note: due to molar ratios, there are two moles of $NO_{2}$ produced per mole of $N_{2}O_{4}$ consumed.\n\t- Hence, $[NO_{2}]$ is increased by 2x, $[N_{2}O_{4}]$ is **decreased** by x.\n\t\t- Can't be both increased, that would be magic!\n\n### NB\nRegardless of whether you *increase* or *decrease* temperature, the **endothermic** reaction is always going to be affected the most.

More products are produced than consumed, so the product concentrations rise *and so the reverse reaction rate increases*. More reactants are consumed than produced, so the reactant concentrations fall *and so the forward reaction rate decreases*. This occurs until the rates are equal, and equilibrium is re-established *having shifted right.*\n\n",

Wo are the romantic writers and what are they famous for? Significance? Characteristics of their work?\n- Find some examples of romantic literature and add a piece (could be a small excerpt) of prose and a poem to your notes. Give a brief outline of the pieces you choose (who wrote it and what is it about?).\n- Add two pieces of romantic art to your notes and add details. Also add notes on the characteristics that make them romantic.\n\n## What is Romanticism?\n\nRomanticism is a movement within both art and literature throughout the 18th to 19th century. It came about as a form of revolution against the previous Neoclassical movement prevalent in Europe within the 17th to 18th centuries, which promoted a return to classical Greek and Roman artistic elements. It is influenced by the French Revolution, with ideals of fraternity, liberty and equality and an emphasis of democracy over monarchy.\n\n\u003e [!Quote]\n\u003e **\"literature depicting emotional matter in an imaginative form\"**\n\u003e - *Friedrich Schlegel* in regards to romantic literature (from *Athenäeum-Fragment*, 1798)\n\nThere are many people that can be considered romantics. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelly, William Blake, John Keats, Mary Shelly, Edgar Allen Poe, Lord Byron are just some examples of prominent Romantic authors. \n\nAt its core Romanticism seeks to express the internal emotions of the author that would be \"mould into art\" (Lyrical Ballades, Wordsworth). In order to express such emotions, emphasis was placed on exploring imagination, and a resistance to rules and restrictions placed on literature at the time. Other romantic tenets include adherence to originality, love of nature and a sense of curiosity and restlessness to explore the natural world and one's self.\n\nRomanticism is also considered to be a significant art movement, appearing in the 1760s first as a form of architecture before being portrayed in landscape paintings, such as Thomas Jones' *The Bard* (1774). Notable Romantic art include those that depict events of the French Revolution, such as Eugène Delacroix's *Liberty Leading the People*. \n\n![[000_Files/000a_images/The Bard.png]]\n\n![[000_Files/000a_images/Liberty Leading the People.png]]\n\nThe most prominent Romantic authors would be:\n### William Wordsworth\nWordworth is most famous for his autobiographical poem \"The Prelude\". However his most significant publication would be \"Lyrical Ballades\" (1798) which was co-authored by another important Romantic author, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wordsworth is also known for smaller publications such as \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\". A common theme of Wordsworth's works is that they are written in mostly simplistic, plain English. Wordsworth abstained from using complex words as they would be less understood by the average reader.\n\n### Samuel Taylor Coleridge\nLike Wordsworth, Coleridge's most prominent work is \"Lyrical Ballades\", of which poems he contributed such as \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Tintern Abbey\". Coleridge has many notable contributions to the Romantic movement, such as \"Kubla Khan\" and \"Biographica Literaria\", the latter of which pioneered the Romantic movement by giving it its philosophy. Coleridge used the supernatural as a means of producing suspension, disbelief, and ultimately satisfaction for the reader. Made the supernatural seem somewhat familiar. Kubla Khan focused on sounding good rather having intrinsical meaning.\n\n### Percy Bysshe Shelly \nShelly's most renowned works would be \"Ozymandias\" (1818), \"To a Skylark\" (1820) and \"Prometheus Unbound\" (1820). Shelly was a radical thinker for the Romantics at the time, and would go on to influence numerous other literary movements alongside the Romantic era. Shelly often uses symbolism and imagery to create a visual setting for the reader. A sense of musicality is  also applied in Shelly's  works.\n\n### William Blake\nWhile Blake was mostly outcast throughout his life, his works present him as an early Romantic, with notable works such as \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\", \"The Book of Thel\" and \"Continental prophesies\". Blake used the common devices found in Romantic literature, such as symbolism and visual imagery, and also employed figurative language and allegory.\n\n### John Keats\nKeats is considered part of the second generation of great English poets. Works such as \"Keats's Poetry and Prose\" and \"The Complete Poems\" demonstrated his status as a Romantic author. Notable critics describe John Keats' characteristic dreamlike writing style as commonplace in his works, as Keats tended to focus on the beauty of nature and an exploration of the senses. He explored sentiment of the individual from the industrial revolution.\n\n### Mary Shelly\nIn contemporary times Mary Shelly's most notable and well known work, \"Frankenstein\" has pioneered the modern Gothic genre. However, \"Frankenstein\" is a cornerstone work of the Romantic movement. Frankenstein explores how power can be misappropriated for ill intent, which became a recurring theme in future Romantic works. Shelly's writing style was artiqulate and vibrant, with an exhaustive use of figurative language to convey a strong visualisation of her works.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e “… I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness”\n\u003e - Chapter 5, \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\", Shelley (1818)\n\n*Frankenstein (1818) is a Romantic novel authored by Mary Shelly which follows the life of scientist Viktor Frankenstein who creates a conscience being via an unconventional science experiment.*\n\n## Romantic ~~Art~~ Music\n\n### 1. Tchaikovsky's \"The Nutcracker\"\nThe Nutcracker is known for its delicate waltzes and its subtle, expressive motifs. It was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a ballet suite. \n\n### 2. Chopin's \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\"\nFantaisie-Impromptu is a solo piano piece composed  by Frédéric Chopin. It features many melodic motifs commonplace in Romantic music, such as heavy use of arpeggios. The piece is inspired by Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\", who is himself a transitional composer between the Classical to Romantic eras. \n\nI ran out of creativity\n\n",

  "/Ross-River-Virus": {
    "title": "Ross River Virus",
    "content": "\n### Structure\nRoss River Virus is an endemic RNA virus found predominantly in Australia, but has been discovered in other Pacific nations such as Papua New Guinea.  \n\nComing under the classification of an Alphavirus, the Ross River Virus' genome is entirely made of RNA.  The shape of the Ross River Virus is also spherical, and the virus itself is incredibly small, being around 70nm in diameter. The Ross River Virus is single-stranded alongside being a RNA virus.\n\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221101091915.png)\n\nwhen the virus passes through a cell's membrane, this RNA is released to order the cell's nucleus to replicate virus RNA and proteins. The presence of a protein shell (capsid) located within the membrane protects the genome and allows a stable environment for the genome to persist against biological and chemical agents. This combats defence mechanisms employed by cells, such as protease. The viral envelope surrounding a Ross River Virus' protein shell is comprised from the intracellular membrane of the virus' host cell, which allows the virus to pass through other membranes of similar cells. This is aided by the presence of glycoproteins dispersed on the virus' envelope.\n\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221101092948.png)\n\n### Symptoms\nRoss River Virus is loosely termed \"epidemic polyarthritis\", with its primary symptoms being arthritis and joint pain, alongside a rash occurring around 10 days after arthritis. Infection also comes with flu-like symptoms, such as flu, chills, and headaches.\n\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221101143227.png)\n\nMost concerningly, Ross River Virus causes fatigue in almost all cases (90%), which can turn into chronic fatigue, which affects 9% of individuals a year after infection.\n\nIts virulence is quite potent, causing fatigue and arthritis-related symptoms that can significantly damage an infected person's body. However, it is not fatal, with not a single death as a result of Ross River Virus being reported.\n\n### Risk\nMost cases of Ross River Virus are found within Queensland, the Northern Territory, and tropical regions of Western Australia, with the risk of contracting Ross River Virus increasing greater rainfall. In tropical areas, cases of Ross River Virus are more common during the \"wet season\", i.e. when rainfall is at its greatest, and mosquito populations are high. Specific areas of high risk are communities near the Murray River.\n\nIndividuals near adequate areas for mosquito breeding (marsh, wetland, standing water) are more at risk, and thus Ross River Virus mostly affects rural areas. \n\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221101093120.png)\n\nThere is no distinction between how the virus affects gender, but adults aged between 25-44 years old are more likely to be infected.\n\n### Mode of Transmission\nThe virus is indirectly spread via vectors, i.e. mosquitos. Virus particles are transmitted to a host population via a second separate population. In this case, individuals of the second population are considered \"vectors\", and usually are blood-sucking arthropods such as mosquitos and ticks. Ross River Virus uses mosquitos as a vector, most prevalently mosquitos of the Aedes genus.\n\n![](000_Files/mosquito.png)\n\nTransmission for Ross River Virus occurs when a vector bites an infected individual, which a chance of the disease being transmitted to the vector. This vector then bites another individual. At this stage, the individual is not yet infected. However, if the virus is not eradicated within the individual's body, the individual becomes infectious after a latency period. A new vector can then bite the newly infected individual, repeating the cycle.\n\n### Graph Analysis\n![](000_Files/Pasted%20image%2020221101112709.png)\n(sourced from the Department of Health and Aged Care website)\n\nThis graph shows that outbreaks of the Ross River Virus are periodical, occurring mostly every January, which is during Summer in Western Australia. After Summer ends, cases drop off significantly. This is a sign that the Ross River Virus is seasonal, and is most common during the Summer period. The data from the graph indicates that the number of Ross River Virus cases is directly linked to the climate of the environment, i.e. what season it is in.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\nPatients are given painkillers, anti-inflammatories or corticosteroids for rashes, and anti-pyretics for fevers. They are told to rest, as there is no definitive cure against the virus. As of 2016, researchers at Griffith University were conducting trials into the effectiveness of Elmiron (pentosan polysulfate), which appeared to be promising. Due to there being no cure, patients of Ross River Virus must battle with the virus to gain natural immunity.\n\nA vaccine for Ross River Virus does not exist. Thus, the main form of prevention for this virus is minimising mosquito bites, as this is the only vector that transmits the virus. People living near high risk areas are told to frequently use mosquito repellent, wear light-coloured clothing, reducing standing water around their homes, etc. As there is no vaccine, there is no form of artificial immunity to Ross River Virus. If an individual recovers from Ross River Virus (which usually takes 3-6 months),  studies show this individual will gain both passive and active immunity to the virus, which last for life.\n\n### APA7 References\n- Horwood, C.

    "content": "\nIn simplistic terms, the Ross River Virus is an Alphavirus found commonly in Australia. As an RNA virus, it consists of a protein shell, viral envelope, lipid proteins, glycoproteins and a single-stranded genome. The protein shell creates a protective environment for the genome, which can resist a cell's defence mechanisms against the virus. The viral envelope is usually made of cell membrane, which allows the virus to pass through other cell membranes with ease. The glycoproteins allows the virus to be accepted by the receptors of a targeted cell. In general, the single-stranded genome allows for more frequent and impactful mutations, which can greatly affect the virulence of future variants of the virus. This all makes the Ross River Virus very good at breaching a cell's membrane and releasing its genome into the cell, leading to the virus's replication and continued existence.\n\nSymptoms of Ross River Virus are primarily arthritis and joint pain followed by a rash, fatigue and flu-like symptoms. Over time, fatigue can develop into chronic fatigue, which will affect 9% of infected individuals after a year with the disease. However, despite the significant impacts the Ross River Virus has on an individual's health, it has low virulence with no reported cases of death. \n\nAreas with high rainfall are the most susceptible to Ross River Virus outbreaks. This is further amplified during seasonal changes, specifically during \"wet seasons\". Communities nearby viable breeding areas for mosquitos are also at risk. Because of this, rural regions are most affected by Ross River Virus. Gender does not influence an individual's susceptibility to the virus, but adults aged 25 to 44 have a greater chance to be infected.\n\nThe virus is transmitted via vectors, specifically mosquitos. For the Ross River Virus, individuals of a secondary carrier population are considered \"vectors\", and are usually blood-sucking arthropods such as mosquitos and ticks. Ross River Virus uses mosquitos as a vector, most prevalently mosquitos of the Aedes genus. An infected individual's blood is sucked by a vector, which can then carry the virus and bite an uninfected individual, transmitting the virus.\n\nThis graph shows that outbreaks of the Ross River Virus are periodical, occurring mostly every January, which is during Summer in Western Australia. After Summer ends, cases drop off significantly. This is a sign that the Ross River Virus is seasonal, and is most common during the Summer period. \n\n- A cure for Ross River Virus does not yet exist, but trials conducted by Griffith University using pentosan polysulfate have been promising. Doctors currently recommend patients to take painkillers, anti-inflammatories and anti-pyretics, and patients are asked to rest. In extreme cases, patients can be hospitalised to be given intravenous fluids or further care regarding fever, pain, etc.\n- Prevention is difficult for the Ross River Virus, as it is transmitted via mosquitos. Thus, the only means of prevention is to reduce the chance of a bite from an infected mosquito. Individuals living near sites at risk of Ross River Virus are told to use mosquito repellent and reduce any standing water around them.\n\t- There is no vaccine for Ross River Virus, and thus there is no artificial immunity. However, individuals infected by Ross River Virus that recover gain natural immunity for life.\n\n",

    "content": "\n## The Problem with Nuclear Waste\n\n## Summary\nNuclear waste is presently a fundamentally hard issue that must be overcome before nuclear energy becomes sustainably viable. The issue with current nuclear reactors is that they allow the build-up of heavy radioactive waste, which has incredibly long half-lives and will produce toxic radiation for millennia. This issue is currently being combatted by disposing the waste deep underground to prevent environmental leaks, and through mitigating the radioactivity of waste. However, there have been some promising proposals to this issue, such as using fast breeder reactors that can break down heavy radioactive waste into harmful and short-lived waste. Proposals like this are still mostly theoretical, and studies into them do not indicate whether they are still feasible.\n\n## What is nuclear waste?\n\nRadioactive waste is measured based on the substance's half-life and its radioactivity:\n(**according to the International Atomic Energy Agency**)\n- HLW High level waste\n- ILW Intermediate level waste\n- LLW Low level waste\n\nThe majority of all nuclear waste is considered LLW or lower, and takes up approximately 90% of the total volume of nuclear waste, while producing mere fractions of the total radiation released by nuclear waste.\n\nStandard nuclear fuel cycles end up producing transuranic waste products, i,e. isotopes with a greater charge than Uranium, and minor actinides, elements created via chains of neutron capture.\n\nIn chains of neutron capture, neutrons are absorbed by large radioisotopes such as Uranium-238, allowing numerous instances of $\\beta -$ decay and the production of heavy actinides. These isotopes take much longer to decay into harmless materials when compared to other radioisotopes, for example while Radium-228 has a half-life of 5.75 years before $\\beta -$ decay, Plutonium-244 has a half life of 80 million years before it undergoes $\\alpha$ decay.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905094700.png]]\n\nWhile HLW account for less than 0.1% of the total volume of nuclear waste, it is the most dangerous in terms of radioactivity, and due to this it has posed incredibly hard to effectively store, considering the quantity of HLW increases by 12000 tonnes every year. Estimates show that it accounts for 95% of all the radiation produces by nuclear waste.\n\n## Dangers of Nuclear waste\nNuclear waste, specifically ILW and HLW, pose significant threats to the environment, if improperly stored. The high levels of radiation released by leaks of nuclear waste can cause cancerous growth in animal and plant life, and cause significant genetic changes that may affect generations of life. \n\nHuman exposure to HLW and ILW results in severe radiation health effects, such as:\n- Vomiting and nausea\n- Increased risk of cancer\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease\n- Skin burns\n- Death\n\n## Compared to coal and gas combustion\nCompared to coal and gas combustion, nuclear energy produces radioactive toxic waste, whereas coal and gas produces greenhouse gasses (GHGs) which unhelpfully amplify the Greenhouse effect.\n\nStudies conducted by the Nuclear Energy Initiative show that the United States alone has avoided producing almost 17,000 million tonnes of Carbon dioxide emissions. This is by discontinuing coal and gas power plants in favour of nuclear power plants, which produce significantly less carbon dioxide or GHG emissions.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906085024.png]]\n\nFurthermore, there is an estimated 250 million tonnes of nuclear waste in storage. In comparison, over a billion tonnes of coal alone is burned for energy, producing approximately 2.86 billion tonnes of purely carbon dioxide emissions. Although nuclear waste is highly toxic to organic life and is a financial burden to store safely, compared to the harmful by-products of coal and gas combustion it has less of a negative impact on the environment. Coal combustion alone contributes the most carbon dioxide emissions when compared to all other sources of energy, and has significantly amplified the effects of the Greenhouse effect.\n\nThus, compared to coal and gas combustion, nuclear waste is much more ecofriendly in terms of its contribution to the Greenhouse effect. \n\n## How waste is currently disposed\nScientists in recently years have tried to mitigate the toxic properties of nuclear waste by treating waste to be more easily stored. This is initially done through vitrification, the process by which nuclear waste is stabilized so that it does not spontaneously react or decay for long periods of time. Numerous other methods of remediation have been considered, such as bio-mediation, as specific biological organisms have shown to be adept at decomposing certain radioactive wastes such as Strontium-90.\n\nIt should be noted that not all nuclear waste has no applications in the real world, and some waste isotopes such as caesium-137 have been used for food irradiation.\n\nCurrently, geological means of storing the waste has been favoured, as it keeps the waste far away from contaminating ecosystems. In general, large, stable geological sites are dug out via either mining equipment or tunnel bores, where waste will be kept. The core idea is that nuclear waste is kept far away from any human activity. Generally, extra security is kept around nuclear waste, such as concrete walls.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906092633.png]]\n\nThis method has not proven to be fully effective, as there have been numerous instances where nuclear waste has leaked from its containment, into local environments. \n\n## Future Methods for Nuclear waste Disposal\nThere have been recent developments in using transmutation, i.e. creating nuclear reactors to transmute nuclear waste into shorter-lived and potentially less dangerous nuclear waste. However, these forms of experimental nuclear reactors most likely will consume more energy than they produce, which makes them financially unsustainable.\n\nThe idea of fast neutron reactors have been thrown around as a viable new type of reactor that solves the issue of nuclear waste. Presently, thermal nuclear reactors are used, where neutrons move at almost exactly the same speed as the nuclear fuel inside the reactor. However, fast neutron reactors are when there is no moderation or slowing-down of neutrons, and instead move at significantly faster velocities.\n\nIn thermal reactors, neutrons move at about 2200m/s, while in fast neutron reactors, neutrons move at more than 9 million m/s.\n\nThe significantly increased speed of neutrons significantly reduces the capture to fission ratio. When a neutron collides with an atom, it can either be absorbed by the atom's nucleus, or cause nuclear fission, which is the fundamental principle of nuclear energy. According to de Broglie's Wavelength Hypothesis, all matter exhibits wave-like properties, including neutrons. Faster neutrons have a larger amplitude and a shorter wavelength, as they have a greater kinetic energy. Thus, when faster neutrons collide with the atoms of nuclear fuel, they spend less time inside the nucleus, and thus are less likely to be absorbed, Furthermore, the intense energy of the neutron increases the chances for fission to occur, as the impact force favours nuclear fission.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906102940.png]]\n\nWith models of fast reactors, breeder reactors become even more viable, which stipulates that a high neutron economy can be managed via fission reactions that produce more neutrons than required to initiate them. In this way, fuel is 'bred', by using these neutrons to convert fertile fuel into fissile fuel. Fertile refers to material that is itself not fissile, but can be converted into fissile material via neutron absorption. For example, when fertile Thorium-232 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes 2 reactions of $\\beta -$ decay to produce fissile Uranium-233.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906143802.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906102131.png]]\n\nIn thermal breeder reactors, this process produces unsustainable, heavy transuranic elements, which compose the majority of HLW and are a major downside to thermal breeder reactors. However, due to the immense speed of neutrons in fast breeder reactors, even the largest and longest-lived nuclear waste can undergo nuclear fission. In doing so, fast breeders can convert HLW into harmless waste that would decay much faster.\n\n![[index.jpg]]\n\nThere are some downsides to fast breeder reactors, however. Currently, the process is entirely experimental, and current data shows that the concept of a breeder reactor may not be feasibly possible in the first place. Experiments have only achieved a neutron to fission ratio of 1.1, which while would sustain a fast breeder reactor, does not allow random loss of neutrons. Furthermore, currently models for fast breeder reactors incur some consequence in their upkeep, for example Thorium-based fast breeder reactors build up Uranium-232 waste, which generally will produce a wide array of radioactive waste. Furthermore, Protactinium-231 is an intermediary atom in the production of fissile Uranium-233, but eventually as concentrations of Thorium-230 decrease, the amount of Protactinium-231 becomes equal with the amount of Protactinium-231 that undergoes neutron absorption, resulting in a significant loss of efficiency and energy produced.\n\nFurthermore, investment into this new concept of nuclear energy is expensive, as fast breeder reactors demand extreme environments and exotic coolants. The need for exotic coolants stems from the idea of elastic collisions, as neutrons that collide with heavy compounds lose minimal amount of energy compared to neutrons that collide with smaller compounds, such as water. Exotic coolants must be cared for and tend to react with materials of the fast breeder reactor, and thus even more money must be expended to sustain the use of these coolants.\n\nThe possibility of liquid metal, or molten salt as mobile phases for transporting nuclear fuel is a promising concept. For example, the BN-600 reactor in Russia uses melted Sodium as its mobile phase. However, Sodium reacts vigorously with standard environments, and there have been numerous instances of fires in the reactor as a result of the Sodium coolant. Furthermore, it appears that the technology and engineering behind fast breeder reactors is simply not advanced enough to accommodate for both the extreme environments and the use of experimental coolants and mobile phases. Molten salt is also viable, however due to the nature of ions, some cations may oxidize and produce insoluble salts that could cause unpredictable damage to the internals of fast breeder reactors. For example, salt containing Chlorine have chloride ions that may absorb neutrons such as when Chlorine-35 becomes Chlorine-36, which beta decays into Sulfur-36. There has been promising study into the use of $FLiBe$ mixtures, i.e molten salt of Fluorine, Lithium and Beryllium. \n\n![[Pasted image 20220906103359.png]]\n\n## Bibliography: APA 7\n- _Thorium fuel cycle — potential benefits and challenges - IAEA_.

    "content": "\nPeriod number is equal the the electron shell that an element's valency electrons occupy. E.g. in period 2, the valence electrons are on the n = 2 shells.\n\nGroups have the same valence electron number, and this will dictate their chemical properties / the ways they bond.\n\nNote: They are **similar** but not the same. Some are more/less reactive than others.\n\nMost elements will try to reach stability of **nearest noble gas**. \n\nE.g. Potassium has an electronic configuration of $2,8,8,1$, it will achieve stability by losing electrons to have the electron configuration of its nearest noble gas (Argon). \n\nAs you go lower on a group, elements get more reactive.\n\nThis is because attraction to nucleus is lower as the number of shells increase (and the distance from the energy levels and nucleus increases).\n\nTo become an ion you require ionisation energy.\n\nIonisation energy is needed to break the attraction between an electron and its nucleus, so the further away an electron is from its nucleus the weaker the attraction force, and thus less ionisation energy is required to ionise.\n\n\n\n\nThus, elements in higher periods are more reactive.\n\nTherefore, elements in higher periods have lower ionisation energy.\n\n**Non-metals typically gain electrons.**\n\nTypical behaviour of group 7 (non-metals) is to gain electrons.\n\n**Check for diatomic molecules!!**\n\ne.g.\n\n$Cl_{2}+ 2\\bar e \\rightarrow 2Cl^-$\n\nWhat is charge of nitride\n\nNitrogen has an electron configuration of $2,5$. Therefore, if it wants to reach stability via its nearest noble gas (Neon), which has an electron configuration of $2,5$, it must gain 3 electrons, becoming negative.\n\n$N_{2}+ 6 \\bar e \\rightarrow 2N^{-3}$ - this is the **reduction reaction** for nitrogen. redox be like\n\nThe actual electron description formula (?) is:\n\n$N+ 3 \\bar e \\rightarrow N^{-3}$\n\nNote here we are simply describing the redistribution of electrons for one nitrogen atom. Realistically, if this were to happen in nature it would involve 2 atoms, as Nitrogen is diatomic.\n\nBecause nitrogen has a smaller atom, and when nitrogen gains electrons, the nucleus's attraction to the electron will be stronger than, for example, phosphorus, as the nucleus' attractive force will be stronger as distance decreases.\n\n**Principle quantum number** is the term for n.\n\n**A new energy level of shell is started at the beginning of each new Period.**\n\n**Period number is the principle quantum number of the shell being filled.**\n\n**Group number is the number of electrons in the outer shell.** (somewhat, not including the transition metals)\n\nTo determine whether something is polar or non-polar, you have to take into account the following:\n* relative **electronegativity** of composite atoms\n* shape of molecule\n\nLooking at **symmetry** of charges, not the symmetry of molecules.\n\nDipole is cancelled. \n\nDipole refers to the slightly negative/positive areas of a molecule\n\n**Periodic Trends**:\n* Electronegativity **increases** across a period because:\n1. The atomic radius **decreases**. \n2. The charge of the nucleus **increases** without significant extra shielding. New electrons do not contribute much to shielding because they are added to the same principal energy level across the period.\n\n* Electronegativity **decreases** down a period because:\n1. The atomic radius **increases**.\n2. Although the charge on the nucleus increases, shielding also **increases** significantly. This is because electrons added down the group fill new principle electron levels.\n\n**Ionisation Energy**:\n* Upon applying energy, solids will turn into liquids, which will turn into gas.\n* This is called vaporisation.\n* If energy is continuously applied, a gas becomes an ion.\n* However, there are two processes for the two types of ion.\n* For the cation process, energy is absorbed.\n* For the anion process, energy is released.\n* Ionisation energy is:\n\t* **Energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.**\n\ne.g. $X_{g} \\rightarrow X^+_{g}+\\bar e^-$\n\n**The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.**\n\nThe first ionisation energy is therefore a measure of the strength of the attraction between the outermost electron and the nucleus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n**Effective nuclear charge** = **Nuclear charge** - **shielding**.\n\nGoing across a period, nuclear charge increases.\n\nWhen atomic radius decreases, electrons become closer and closer to the nucleus. Thus, it would be difficult to remove electrons from an atom. \n\n**There is a general increase in the first ionisation energies across periods.**\n\nAcross period 3, the proton number increases but the amount of shielding does not change significantly. \nThe effective nuclear charge **increases**.\n\nThe greater attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons mean\n\nOuter electrons are closer to the nucleus, thus they will experience **stronger nuclear attraction**, and thus will require more energy to remove from an atom.\n\n**Always mention more/less energy required!!!!**\n\nAs you move along the period, e.g. from Sodium to Argon,\n\n* Nuclear charge increases.\n* **Atomic radius decreases?!!!**\n* The principal quantum number (energy shell) stays the same for elements in a period.\n\n\nIncreasing the number of electrons in the inner shells will shield outermost electrons from occupying the outermost principal quantum number .\n\n**As nuclear charge increases, electrons in n=1 become closer. This applies for all other shells.**\n\ne.g. Na has an atomic charge of 11. In comparison, Argon has a charge of 18. Because of this, it will attract the electrons in n=1 better (electrostatic attraction increases)\n\nElectronegativity: Is the ability for an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons in a covalent bond.\n\nCovalent bond: shared pair of electrons in a chemical bond\n\nValence electrons of non-metals that are not shared in the chemical bond are called **lone pairs**. /non bonding\n\nHCl is a polar molecule.\n\nHydrogen has no shielding, whereas chlorine has 10 electrons of shielding. Thus, hydrogen's nucleus is more attracted to chlorine's electrons than chlorine is to its. Therefore, chlorine pulls hydrogen towards its nucleus closer than hydrogen pulls chlorine. \n\nWe would write chlorine as $\\delta -$ , as since it pulls hydrogen closer the electron shared is closer to chlorine, and we write hydrogen as $\\delta +$, as its partially lost its electron.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220315150921.png]]\n\nHere, hydrogen has a weaker positive nuclear attractive force than chlorine (10 of its charge is shielded by it), so it does not attract the **bonding pair** as much as chlorine \n\n\n==Patterns in the Periodic table:\n\n==Across the period, atomic radius will decrease. (increasing electrons will increase attraction between them and nucleus, decreasing radius)\n\n==Going down groups, atomic radius will increase. (shells are being added). \n\n* ==Electrons are added to a new shell as you go down a period.\n* ==Nuclear charge increases,\n* ==Effective nuclear charge\n\n==Larger atoms mean that valence electrons can be lost more easily, as they are further away from the nucleus and thus experience less weak nuclear attraction force. \n\n==**Valency**:\n\n* ==*Valency is the **combining power** of an atom and is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms it could combine with or displace from a compound. (Hydrogen has a valency of 1)*\n* ==**Valency and number of valence electrons are not the same thing**\n* ==e.g. Nitrogen:\n\t* ==Nitrogen has a valency of 3, thus to achieve stability via gaining the electron configuration of nearest noble gas, it must lose 3 electrons. \n\t* ==Here, the number of valence electrons is 5, but the valency is 3.\n* ==**Principle quantum shells - refers to the shells of an atom. e.g. Sodium's principle quantum shells represents 2,8,1.**\n* ==*Nuclear attraction is derived from the nuclear charge of an element minus the number of **inner** electrons shielding the outer electrons.*\n* ==**Electronegative - higher density of electrons**\n\n* ==Going **across** a period will **increase nuclear charge**!\n\t* ==If the molecule is symmetrical it is non-polar and doesn't have dipole-dipole==\n",

    "content": "\n## The big question:\n\n- Suppose we have n-permutators, i.e. permutators of total size n (a 7 permutator will contain numbers from 1 to 7). How many n-permutators have loop length l?\n\nHow to approach this: We must go case-wise, and first analyse the numbers given to determine what method we should use.\n\nHere are the following possible cases:\n\n### C1: $l\\le n, l$ is prime\n\nWe must use **only translation method**.\n\nReasoning: We cannot use LCM method, as since $l$ is prime it will not have any factors other than 1 and itself.\n- Note that using $l,1$ as the factors makes no sense, as a group of means nothing can be changed.\n- Hence, we would be doing just $l$, which is the same as the translation method.\n\t- Hence the LCM method *kinda does apply?* We can consider the translation method a subpart of the LCM method.\n\n### C2: $l \\le n,l$ is not prime\n\nWe must use **both** translation **and** LCM method (or as stated above, LCM including translation)\n\nReasoning: Translation is viable as $l\\le n$. LCM is viable since $l$ is not prime, i.e. has common factors that can produce $l$ as their LCM.\n\n### C3: $l\u003en,l$ is prime\n\n**Neither method used.** Total n-permutators = **0**.\n\nReasoning: Translation is not viable as $l\u003en$. LCM is not viable as $l$ is prime. Hence, there is no method to find n-permutators, hence none exist.\n\n### C4: $l\u003en, l$ is not prime\nl\nWe must only use **LCM method**. \n\nReasoning: Translation is not viable as $l\u003en$. LCM is viable as $l$ is not prime.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Translation\n\nSuppose we have $l \\le n$.\n\nThat means we can directly choose a group of numbers of size $l$, and by arranging the numbers in this group such that **none remain in their original spot**, we have produced an n-permutator with loop length $l$.\n\nThe formula for this is as follows:\n\n$n$-permutators =${n\\choose l} \\times (l-1)!$\n\n## LCM Method\n\nSuppose $l$ is not prime.\n\n$l$ thus has factors other than one and itself. Let us express $l$ as these factors:\n\n$l = a\\times b \\times c \\times \\dots$, where $a,b,c,\\dots$ have no common factor.\n\nHence, we must consider grouping each of these factors.\n\nThe formula for this is as follows:\n\n$n$-permutators $= {n \\choose (a+b+c+\\dots)} \\times {(a+b+c+\\dots) \\choose a} \\times {(b+c+\\dots) \\choose b} \\times \\dots \\times (a-1)!\\times (b-1)!$\n\n\u003e [!warning] IMPORTANT!\n\u003e Please read the \"Multiple groups of same size\" section, as this will most likely be important for your answer.\n\n## Very important things to realise!\n\n### Composite compatibility\n\nSuppose $l$ is not prime. \n\nThe equations only hold **if, and only if** the factors of $l$ add up to $\\le l$ **AND** share no common factors *within the factors of $l$*, alongside the other conditions.\n\nFor example, take a loop length of 12 for a 7-permutator.\n\n12's factors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. We don't count 1 cause bruh.\n\nHence, 2,3,4,6,12 are potential groupings. We eliminate those greater than n, i.e. 12.\n\nWe are left with 2,3,4,6 as potential groupings.\n\nIn this case, we know that the groupings **must have LCM of 12** AND their sum be less than 7. \n\n$2\\times 6$ would be viable, yielding $12$, but $2+6 = 8, 8\u003e7$.\n\nWe are left with $3,4$. These are factors that share no common factors within themselves, and have LCM of $l$.\n\nIt follows these are the only solutions to $n=7,l=12$.\n\nNow take a loop length of 8 for a 7-permutator.\n\nOnce again, factors of 8 are 1,2,4,8. One is not counted, and as $8\u003e7$, it is not possible.\n\nHence, we are left with factors $2,4$. But the issue is, these factors **share common factor of 2!** Hence we must also disregard this case, and are left with no possible factors.\n\nAnd thus, there are **no solutions** for loop length 8, 7-permutator.\n\n\n### Multiple groups of same size\n\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Key Part\n\u003e\n\u003e Sometimes, if the value of $l$ is small enough such that the sum of its factors are $\\ll n$, we can add groups with the same size as one of the factors to create new permutators, still within the limit of $\u003cl$.\n\nTake $n=7,l=6$.\n\nInitially, one would approach this by determining the 7-permutators with the following groupings:\n\n\\{6\\},\\{2,3\\}\n\nNotice how $2+3=5, 5\\le7$. But if we were to do $\\{2,2,3\\}$, we would get $2+2+3=7, 7\\le 7$.\n\nHence, we can essentially **double *or triple* up** on groupings of small factors to create new permutators.\n\nHence, revisiting the total groupings:\n\n\\{6\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{2,2,3\\}\n\nThese are all the possible groupings.\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Even Keyer part\n\u003e\n\u003e Let $r$ be the amount of times we repeat factor a. When calculating the LCM formula for said grouping, i.e. {$a,a,a(r \\ times),b$} we must divide by $r!$.\n\nSuppose $n=7,l=6$.\n\nIt follows that the segment of the solution corresponding to $\\{2,2,3\\}$ is:\n$\\frac{{n \\choose (ra+b)} \\times {(ra+b) \\choose a} \\times {((r-1)a + b) \\choose a} \\times \\dots \\times {b \\choose b} \\times ((a-1)!)^{r}\\times (b-1)!}{r!}$\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Less Keyer part\n\u003e\n\u003e We can have multiple factors with multiple instances of their groupings. This is especially true for greater values of $n,l$.\n\n\n## Key examples\n\n$n=7,l=6$\n\nWe know $l \\le n, l$ is non-prime.\n\nHence, we must use translation and LCM method.\n\nHence, the groupings are as follows:\n\n\\{6\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{2,2,3\\}\n\nHence, the total 7-permutators are as follows:\n\n$${7 \\choose 6}\\times (6-1)! + {7 \\choose 5} \\times ({5 \\choose 2} \\times {3 \\choose 3} \\times (2-1)! \\times (3-1)!) + {7 \\choose 7} \\times \\frac{{7\\choose 2} \\times {5 \\choose 3} \\times {3 \\choose 3} \\times (2-1)! \\times (2-1)! \\times (3-1)!}{2!}$$\n\n$n=12, l = 6$\n\nWe know $l \\le n, l$ is non-prime.\n\nHence, we must use translation and LCM method.\n\nHence, the groupings are as follows:\n\n\\{6\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{2,2,3\\},\\{2,2,2,3\\},\\{2,2,2,2,3\\},\\{2,3,3\\},\\{2,3,3,3\\}\n\nI will leave the rest of the solution as an exercise for the reader. Note that we will probably not get a question of such a scale.\n\n$n=7, l = 8$\n\nWe know that $l\u003e8, l$ is non-prime, so we can **only use LCM method**.\n\nYet, LCM method does not give any possible groupings, as all viable groupings have common factors and thus do not have LCM of 8.\n\n(This can be summaried by saying 8 has no factors that sum to less than 7 that give LCM of 8.)\n\nHence, no groupings exist for LCM.\n\nThus, there exists 0 7-permutators for loop length 8.\n\n$n=7,l=5$\n\nWe know $l\\le n, l$ is prime. \n\nSo we can only use translation method.\n\nThus,\n\n7-permutators $= {7 \\choose 5}\\times(5-1)!$\n\n\n$n = 5, l = 7$\n\nWe know $l \u003e n,l$ is prime.\n\nThis means we cannot use both translation and LCM method. There is thus no way to create a 5-permutator with loop length 7.\n\nHence, 5-permutators = 0 \n\n\nDONE\n\n*With love(but not for dasindu)*\n\n*Ed* ",

This allows for more algal blooms.\n- Turbidity benefits toxic algal blooms, as they float up and out-compete other algae struggling for light.\n- **Managing local conditions provides short-term help**, rather than reducing the run-off of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e. reducing eutrophication)\n- **Ways to combat algal blooms**:\n\t- Water can be mechanically stirred, this increases oxygen and reduces stratification\n\n## Acid sulfate soils explained\n\n![](https://www.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0011/64010/pyrite.jpg)\n\nMicroscopic image of pyrite in soil\n\nSouthern Cross University\n\nCommon in many parts of the world, acid sulfate soils are saturated with water, almost oxygen-free and contain microscopic crystals of iron sulfide minerals (commonly [pyrite](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/soil/soil-testing/soil-terms)).\n\nAcid sulfate soils are safe and harmless when not disturbed. If acid sulfate soils are dug up or drained they come into contact with oxygen. The pyrite in the soil reacts with the oxygen and oxidises.\n\nThis process turns pyrite into sulfuric acid, which can cause damage to the environment and to buildings, roads and other structures.\n\nThe acid also attacks soil minerals, releasing metals like aluminium and iron. Rainfall can then wash the acid and metals from the disturbed soil into the surrounding environment.\n\n\n## Pearson Notes\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e ### 15.1 Essential water\n\n- Sources of chemical contamination:\n\t- Run-off from farms and cities\n\t- Run-off from industrial and mining wastes\n\t- Lead used in solder in copper water pipes\n- Types of chemical contaminants:\n\t- Heavy metals\n\t- Pollutants from fertilisers\n\t- Organic pollutants\n\n- Heavy metal contamination\n\t- The main heavy metals are mercury and lead\n\t- Other heavy metals:\n\t\t- Copper\n\t\t- Lead\n\t\t- Cadmium\n\t\t- Nickel\n\t\t- Zinc\n\t\t- Arsenic\n\t\t- Mercury\n\t\t- Common effects: Cancer, organ/nervous system damage, death\n\t- Mining is a main example of heavy metal contamination\n\t- Another one is water pipes\n\t- **How to remove:** precipitation reaction\n\t\t- Heavy metal cation  is identified\n\t\t- A soluble compound containing an insoluble compound with the cation of the heavy metal is selected\n\t\t- A solution of the compound is added to the water\n\t\t- A precipitation with the heavy metal is produced\n\t\t- Precipitate is filtered off\n- Water monitoring:\n\t- Protocols for water sampling:\n\t\t- The container can be rinsed with the sample before the final sample is taken\n\t\t- The container should be cleaned before taking another sample\n\t\t- The water used for cleaning the container can be tested to ensure there is no contamination between samples.\n\t- Note that if pathogens are being tested for, the container should be sterile\n| Condition                                        | Sampling method                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| sample taken from a well-mixed body of water     | sampling near the surface is sufficient to obtain a representative sample.

Thus water expands, and has a lower density as it freezes.\n- **High surface tension**:\n\t- At the surface of water, molecules are not encased in other water molecules. As a result, hydrogen bonds form between molecules to their side and below them, but not above.\n\t- The sideways forces result in a balance, however due to there being hydrogen bonds below the molecule and not the top, there is an imbalance and molecules at the surface are pulled downwards towards the bulk of the water molecules.\n\t- This downwards force is very fast, and molecules at the surface only spend $1 \\times 10^{-9}$ seconds or 1 nanosecond before being pulled into the bulk of the liquid.\n\t- **Surface tension is a measure of the resistance of a liquid to increase its surface area**. \n\t- As a result of water particles at the surface being pulled towards the bulk of the liquid, water tends not to increase surface area as that would lead to more molecules being pulled towards the bulk, which is energetically unfavourable.\n\t- Thus, water has a high surface tension.\n- **Heat capacity**:\n\t- **Heat capacity - a measure of a substance's capacity of absorb and store heat energy.**\n\t- When heated with a specific amount of energy, water tends to change temperature slower than other substances, such as ethanediol.\n```ad-info\n**Specific heat capacity:** the amount of energy (in joules) needed to increase the temperature of a certain amount (usually 1 gram) of a substance by 1 $\\degree C$\n```\n- Units for specific heat capacity: $J \\ g^{-1} \\ \\degree C^{-1}$\n- **Specific heat capacity** reflects the **type of bonding**.

    "content": "\n## Waves Evaluation and Analysis Task\n\n**By Edward Huynh**\n\nResearch the following topics:\n1. Reflection and refraction with reference to Huygens' principle\n2. Snell's Law of Refraction (including critical angle)\n3. Ultrasound imaging (with specific reference to reflection and refraction)\n\n## Reflection and refraction through Huygens' principle\n\nHuygens' principle relies on the concept of wavefronts, which are specific points, lines or planes in a wave that is repeated as the wave oscillates (i.e. lines made by sound propagating through a 2-dimensional medium). Wavefronts do not necessarily have to be straight, and can be curved(this extends to planes). \n\n![|300](000_Files/000a_images/wavefronts.png)\n*The 2-dimensional sound wave with its compressions and rarefactions can be represented as a set of wavefronts, which occupy the same phase.*\n\nIt is important to note that the wavefronts do not necessarily have to be the compression/peak of a specific wave.\n\nHuygens' principle is the idea that wavefronts can be viewed as a source of infinitely many circular or spherical wavelets. The combined oscillations of the wavelets produce the next wavefront in the wave, which is located tangent to the wavelets, and this repeats indefinitely.\n\n![|275](000_Files/000a_images/SFDSF.png)\n*The wavefronts are produced by wavelets which originate from the previous wavefronts. There are an infinite amount of points on the line, so an infinite number of wavelets are produced by each wavefront. The new wavefront is formed perpendicular to the direction of the wavelets, when the wavelets have finished an oscilation.*\n\nThe wavelets abide to this following equation:\n$$\\begin{align}\ns=vt \n\\end{align}$$\n\nIn this case, $s=\\lambda$, where the radius of the wavelets represents the wavelength, i.e. the distance between wavefronts. $v$ represents the velocity of the wave and $t$ represents the time passed between one oscillation of a wavelet.\n\nHuygens' principle is useful as it can explain natural wave phenomena such as reflection. When wavelets hit the phase mirror, i.e. another medium, the wavelet is produced perpendicular to the mirror. As the wave approaches the medium at an angle, wavelets are produced at different instances, resulting in the observed reflection of the ray.\n\n![|275](000_Files/000a_images/erlkonifgsfs.png)\n\n![|300](000_Files/000a_images/sfsf.png)\n*Here the incident ray and reflected ray have been represented as wavefronts.*\n\n![|325](000_Files/000a_images/sglksf;l.png)\n\n\n\nIn the above image, Huygens' principle is shown to predict the formation of new wavefronts which correspond to the observed wavefronts produced by a reflected ray. This is because wavefront 1 hits the phase mirror faster than wavefront 2, for example. This difference in time is equal to the time taken for a wavelet to produce a wavefront. Upon contacting the phase mirror, the wavelets move in the direction of the reflected ray. Hence, when the wavelet from the 2nd wavefront oscillates(green), the wavelet from the 1st wavefront (cyan) has already produced another wavefront, which itself has in turn oscillated, resulting in two oscillations(green from the cyan wavelet). This repeats until all the wavefronts have hit the phase mirror, and the resultant ray is produced.\n\nHuygens' principle can also explain the natural phenomena of refraction.\n\n![|400](000_Files/000a_images/ar,ndsln.png)\n\nWhen wavefronts come into contact with the barrier between the media, wavelets are produced perpendicular to the barrier. As the wave is now passing through a slower medium, the velocity of the wave is decreased. We know the wave abides to the following relationship:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nv=\\lambda f\n\\end{align}\n$$\nFrequency is a conserved variable in this equation. Hence, as the wave now moves slower, for this equation to remain true the wavelength of the wave decreases. This is evidenced through the decreased radius of the wavelets produced by the incident ray as it comes in contract with the barrier.\n\nFurthermore, the reduced radius of the wavelets results in the resultant wavefronts being more towards the normal, i.e. $\\theta_{r}\u003c\\theta_{i}$. The inverse is true if the incident ray went from a slower to faster medium.\n\n## Snell's Law of Refraction\n\nSnell's Law refers to a mathematical relationship described by Willebrord Snellius in 1621 that describes the phenomena of refraction.\n\nSnell's Law can be described in two different forms: one in reference to the refractive indexes of mediums for a specific type of wave, and one in reference to the velocities of said wave in the mediums that which the wave is refracted through.\n\nConsider the following diagram in reference to the refraction of a wave:\n\n![](000_Files/000a_images/fkjlgfjel.png)\n\nSnell's Law states the following:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{i}}{\\sin\\theta_{r}}=\\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}=\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\theta_{i}$ - angle of incidence\n- $\\theta_{r}$ - angle of refraction\n- $n_{1}$ - refractive index for the first medium\n- $n_{2}$ - refractive index for the second medium\n- $v_{1}$ - velocity of wave/ray in the first medium\n- $v_{2}$ - velocity of wave/ray in the second medium\n\nHence, through Snell's law, one can relate the angles of incident and refraction with either the refractive indexes of the two mediums involved in the refraction or the velocity.\n\nFor example, consider the following question:\n\n\"A light ray is refracted from air to water. The refractive index of air is 1, and the refractive index of water is 1.333. If the angle the refracted ray made with the medium was 40.00$\\degree$, find the initial angle of incidence.\"\n\nThis question becomes trivial when using Snell's Law. Hence, by substitution into Snell's Law:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{i}}{\\sin\\theta_{r}}=\\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{i}}{\\sin 40}=\\frac{1.333}{1} \\\\\n\\therefore \\sin\\theta_{i}=\\sin^{-1}(1.333\\times \\sin 40) \\\\\n\\theta_{i} = 58.96\\degree\n\\end{align}$$\n\nThis follows what has been established by Huygens' principle: a wave going from a fast to slow medium will be more closer to the medium, i.e. have a **lower angle of refraction**. In the question, the wave(which went from a fast to slow medium) went from an angle of incidence of 58.96$\\degree$ to 40$\\degree$.\n\nSnell's Law proves useful when establishing the critical angle. The following diagram illustrates the point of equivalence for a wave going from a slow to fast medium.\n\n![](000_Files/000a_images/sdfs.png)\n\nThrough Snell's Law, alongside additional information, one can establish the value of specific variables. For example, take this question:\n\n\"A light ray has a critical value of 74.6$\\degree$ when refracted between the mediums of water and medium $x$. Find the velocity the light ray travels in medium $x$. (Note that light moves at $2.26\\times 10^{8}ms^{-1}$ in water.)\"\n\nSince this question refers to the critical angle, we know the value of $\\theta_{r}$, namely 90$\\degree$. Hence, substitution into Snell's Law yields the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{i}}{\\sin\\theta_{r}}=\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\sin 74.6}{\\sin 90}=\\frac{2.26\\times 10^{8}ms^{-1}}{v_{2}} \\\\\n\\therefore v_{2}=\\frac{2.26\\times 10^{8}ms^{-1}}{\\sin 74.6} \\\\\nv_{2}=2.34\\times 10^{8}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis answer makes sense as we established that the ray moves faster in medium $x$ (otherwise it would not have a critical angle).\n\nWhen an incident strikes the barrier between the two media at an angle greater than the critical angle (the ray is going from a slower to faster medium), instead of refracting, a phenomena known as **total internal reflection** occurs. When a multitude of waves strike a barrier between two media **in general**, the waves are either **absorbed, refracted or reflected in variable proportions**. However, in this specific case, **refraction does not occur**. The waves are either **absorbed or reflected**. \n\n![|525](000_Files/000a_images/df;ldkfld.png)\n*Here the red incident ray represents an incident ray approaching at the critical angle, i.e. $\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{c}$, the blue ray represents an incident ray approaching at an angle smaller than the critical angle, i.e. $\\theta_{i}\u003c\\theta_{c}$, and the yellow ray represents an incident ray approaching at an angle greater than the critical angle, i.e. $\\theta_{i}\u003e\\theta_{c}$.*\n\nIncident rays approaching at an angle less than the critical angle will evidently refract as normal(alongside the other possibilities; absorption, reflection).\n\nThe concept of **total internal reflection** is useful as it has many immensely helpful use cases, for example, in **fibre optic cables**.\n\n![|300](000_Files/000a_images/fibre%20optic%20cables!!%20wooo.png)\n\n## Ultrasound imaging\n\nUltrasound imaging refers to a medical procedure, that is usually done for the purpose of a medical diagnosis, which uses high-energy electromagnetic waves, specifically ultrasound waves. \n\nUltrasound waves produced in ultrasound imaging are usually around 1-20MHz. Occasionally, higher frequency ultrasound waves are used for specific cases.\n\nThe ultrasound imaging process consists of the following steps:\n1. Apply ultrasound gel\n2. Transmit ultrasound waves through the gel into the desired spot on the body\n3. Receive the echoes of the ultrasound waves\n4. Convert the echos into a sonogram\n\n![](000_Files/000a_images/gkhjlfs.png)\n*(see references for source of image)*\n\nUltrasound gel is crucial to the process. Ultrasound waves can incur marginal amounts of reflection and refraction while in air, and so ultrasound gel is used to circumvent this, as it gives a better path between the transmitter of the ultrasound waves and the tissue that the ultrasound waves are meant to make contact with. The ultrasound gel does this as it is a more homogenous medium than air, hence ultrasound waves are less disrupted by heterogenous areas within air. Hence, ultrasound waves passing through it are less disrupted (absorbed, reflected, refracted), and so a clearer image can be produced from the echoes of the ultrasound waves.\n\nUltrasound gel also reduces the **acoustic impedance** of the targeted tissue, that is to say it reduces the resistance or opposition to the incoming ultrasound waves, resulting in a clearer image.\n\nIn essence, the presence of ultrasound gel allows for an **acoustic coupling** between the transmitter of ultrasound waves and the human tissue, where the disruption of the ultrasound waves is mitigated and hence a clearer image can be derived from the ultrasound imaging process.\n\nThe transmitter is located quite close to the body when in use, i.e. pressing through the ultrasound gel. This is due to the prevalence of attenuation. Attenuation has a greater effect on high frequency waves in general, hence ultrasound waves are particularly affected by this issue. As the distance travelled by the ultrasound wave increases, the intensity of the wave decreases, i.e. through the partial refraction, reflection and absorption of the waves. Hence by lowering the distance the ultrasound waves have to travel, the effects of attenuation are reduced.\n\nOnce the ultrasound waves reach the tissue of the body,  either reflection, refraction or absorption occurs. Refraction is the preferred phenomena as this allows the ray to pass through the body, reflect off the desired parts of the body, and pass back out of the body, to be picked up by the ultrasound imaging equipment and thus be processed into a sonogram. A greater extent of reflection results in a brighter image, as the ultrasound imaging equipment will increase the intensity of the pixels in the sonogram with a greater intensity of received ultrasound waves. \n\nIn terms of the reflection, it can be either **specular** or **diffuse**. Specular reflection occurs when the barrier between the two mediums is quite smooth. Hence, when a multitude of ultrasound waves(with the same angle of incidence) come into contact with the barrier, the normals of the waves are roughly the same, hence the waves are reflected in the same way, as we know $\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{r}$ for reflection, and since the waves have the same angle of incidence they will have the same angle of reflection.\n\nSpecular reflection is preferred as this results in a more intense overall ultrasound wave being reflected instead of a scattered multitude of waves, resulting in a more finer image. Specular reflection is achieved by pointing the transmitter directly towards the tissue. If the tissue targeted is rough, the transmitter is moved around.\n\nAfter the ultrasound waves have passed through the body and have refracted out from the body, they cause a transducer to vibrate, which are then processed through the ultrasound imaging equipment. This equipment uses the data of the time taken, angle of the returning ultrasound wave and the resultant intensity of the wave to create the desired sonogram.\n\nTo calculate the distance between the specific thing measured in the body and the transmitter, the law of reflection($\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{r}$), Snell's Law and $s=vt$. This is used to determine the intensity and placement of pixels in a black and white image.\n\nThis image is known as a sonogram, and depicts the general structure and density of the specific parts of the human body that was measured.\n\nUltrasound imaging as a medical resource has many advantages, for example it does not use ionising radiation, and thus is a relatively safer diagnostic tool when compared to tools that rely on ionising radiation, e.g. x-rays. Furthermore, the equipment required is relatively light-weight and can be transported throughout a medical facility. Additionally, as the waves are relatively low energy compared to x-rays, they are able to reflect at non-perpendicular angles. While x-rays can only give a bird's eye view as the resulting image, due to ultrasound waves being able to reflect in such a way, they give more information.\n\nHowever, as ultrasounds have a lower energy than other electromagnetic radiation used in medicine (x-rays), it has a lower frequency, which can correlate to a reduced quality of the resultant image (sonogram). Furthermore, due to the nature of the ultrasound imaging process, it is difficult to determine the location where ultrasound imaging was used through the sonogram. When using ultrasound imaging, one has to actively be there to see both the sonogram and the location of the transmitter to determine diagnostic information.\n\n## References (APA 7)\n- Born, M., \u0026 Wolf, E.

    "content": "\nObserving a buoy in the ocean shows that the buoy moves up and down but does not move side by side, i.e. towards or away from the shore. This is because the water wave causes the buoy to move in a circular direction as the water in the wave moves in circular orbits. As the buoy rises up the peak of the wave(compression), it is also being pushed forward, but as the buoy falls into the trough of the wave(rarefaction) it is being pulled backwards. This results in a net 0 displacement of the buoy side by side, and we observe the buoy as moving up and down. Furthermore, the water in the wave is not displaced, as the wave is longitudinal.\n\nHowever, this process is disrupted in more shallow waters, as the presence of the bottom(the floor of the ocean) affects the circular motion of the water, resulting in the water(and the buoy) being pulled towards the shore,  if that is in the direction of the wave.

This is what I hope will be a brief notice to inform you that I will be taking down "Ed's Obsidian Notes" for the foreseeable future. Here's a summary of what will happen.</p><div id=summary><li>"https://ed.toomwn.xyz/ is now a placeholder, hosting this page and also the <a href=https://ed.toomwn.xyz/Goodbye>Goodbye</a> page.</li><li>All the code for the final product of "obsidiannotes-v-4" will be made public on the <a href=https://github.com/EddieTheEd/obsidiannotes-v.4-public>public repository</a>.</li><li>Once me and Ossac have finished work on <a href=https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Blaze>Blaze</a>, our homemade Quartz alternative, I will re-upload "Ed's Obsidian Notes", presumably under a different name.</li></div><p>I know this seems a little rash. Why don't I just keep the website up so people can access my notes and stuff? Well to be honest, I've kinda grown to dislike my website. I think its great how Quartz enables people to make their own static sites, but I think I've outgrown it. So many thanks to <a href=https://jzhao.xyz/>Jacky Zhao</a> for inspiring me to embark on this journey. Hopefully I'll see you again, with a fully functioning website, very soon!</p><p id=signature>- Ed :)</p></div></body></html>
